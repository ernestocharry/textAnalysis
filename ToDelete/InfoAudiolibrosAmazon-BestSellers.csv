An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones","The number one New York Times best seller. Over one million copies sold!

Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results

No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving - every day. James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results.

If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.

Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, listeners will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.

Learn how to:

Make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy)
Overcome a lack of motivation and willpower
Design your environment to make success easier
Get back on track when you fall off course
And much more
Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits - whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.","Atomic Habits was a great read. I learned a lot and think it’ll be helpful to a lot of people.""","In Atomic Habits, Clear will show you how to overcome a lack of motivation, change your environment to encourage success, and make time for new (and better) habits"

The Power of Knowing What You","Intelligence is usually seen as the ability to think and learn, but in a rapidly changing world, there's another set of cognitive skills that might matter more: the ability to rethink and unlearn. In our daily lives, too many of us favor the comfort of conviction over the discomfort of doubt. We listen to opinions that make us feel good, instead of ideas that make us think hard. We see disagreement as a threat to our egos, rather than an opportunity to learn. We surround ourselves with people who agree with our conclusions, when we should be gravitating toward those who challenge our thought process. The result is that our beliefs get brittle long before our bones. 

We think too much like preachers defending our sacred beliefs, prosecutors proving the other side wrong, and politicians campaigning for approval - and too little like scientists searching for truth. 

Intelligence is no cure, and it can even be a curse: Being good at thinking can make us worse at rethinking. The brighter we are, the blinder to our own limitations we can become.

Organizational psychologist Adam Grant is an expert on opening other people's minds - and our own. As Wharton's top-rated professor and the best-selling author of Originals and Give and Take, he makes it one of his guiding principles to argue like he's right but listen like he's wrong. With bold ideas and rigorous evidence, he investigates how we can embrace the joy of being wrong, bring nuance to charged conversations, and build schools, workplaces, and communities of lifelong learners. You'll learn how an international debate champion wins arguments, a Black musician persuades White supremacists to abandon hate, a vaccine whisperer convinces concerned parents to immunize their children, and Adam has coaxed Yankees fans to root for the Red Sox. 

Think Again reveals that we don't have to believe everything we think or internalize everything we feel. It's an invitation to let go of views that are no longer serving us well and prize mental flexibility over foolish consistency. If knowledge is power, knowing what we don't know is wisdom.

","Think Again is a must-read for anyone who wants to create a culture of learning and exploration, whether at home, at work, or at school.... In an increasingly divided world, the lessons in this book are more important than ever."" (Bill and Melinda Gates)

The best-selling author of Give and Take and Originals examines the critical art of rethinking: learning to question your opinions and open other people's minds, which can position you for excellence at work and wisdom in life","Another great book by Adam Grant. The thing that I love is that 1 this title was actually narrated by the author (which always makes me more comfortable with a book) and 2 in this book he shared his knowledge and even Thought Again about his older work. Happy to have consumed this and I am definitely sharing with all my friends and colleagues!

An Antidote to Chaos","What does everyone in the modern world need to know? Renowned psychologist Jordan B. Peterson's answer to this most difficult of questions uniquely combines the hard-won truths of ancient tradition with the stunning revelations of cutting-edge scientific research.

Humorous, surprising, and informative, Dr. Peterson tells us why skateboarding boys and girls must be left alone, what terrible fate awaits those who criticize too easily, and why you should always pet a cat when you meet one on the street.

What does the nervous system of the lowly lobster have to tell us about standing up straight (with our shoulders back) and about success in life? Why did ancient Egyptians worship the capacity to pay careful attention as the highest of gods? What dreadful paths do people tread when they become resentful, arrogant, and vengeful? Dr. Peterson journeys broadly, discussing discipline, freedom, adventure, and responsibility, distilling the world's wisdom into 12 practical and profound rules for life. 12 Rules for Life shatters the modern commonplaces of science, faith, and human nature while transforming and ennobling the mind and spirit of its listeners.","Jordan Peterson, has become one of the best-known Canadians of this generation. In the intellectual category, he’s easily the largest international phenomenon since Marshall McLuhan.... By combining knowledge of the past with a full-hearted optimism and a generous attitude toward his readers and listeners, Peterson generates an impressive level of intellectual firepower","Like the best intellectual polymaths, Peterson invites his readers to embark on their own intellectual, spiritual and ideological journeys into the many topics and disciplines he touches on. It’s a counter-intuitive strategy for a population hooked on the instant gratification of ideological conformity and social media ‘likes,’ but if Peterson is right, you have nothing to lose but your own misery."

What We Should Know About the People We Don't Know","About the Creator and Performer
Malcolm Gladwell is a Canadian journalist, author, and podcaster. He is the host of the podcasts Revisionist History and Broken Record and co-founder of the audio production company Pushkin Industries. For his sixth audiobook, the #1 New York Times audio best-seller Talking to Strangers, he drew on real-life audio–including archival footage and clips from his own interviews—to incorporate the production techniques of a podcast into the audiobook format. It has been praised by Audible listeners as ""a new era in audiobooks…and maybe in relating to others."" He has also written and narrated The Tipping Point (2000); Blink (2005); Outliers (2008); and David and Goliath (2013), all of which are New York Times best-sellers. Gladwell’s books and articles often deal with the unexpected implications of research in the social sciences, particularly sociology, psychology, and social psychology. He was appointed to the Order of Canada in 2011 and has been a staff writer for The New Yorker since 1996. He lives in New York.","A new era in audio books...and maybe in relating to others
I am ruined forever on all the usual audiobooks. This was utterly fabulously produced, and now I shall expect all audiobooks to sound like fascinating podcasts ;) Ha! Really though, Malcolm has dramatically raised the bar on audiobooks. Second, I just had a conversation in which my husband and I were talking about how complex people are....that sometimes things are not as they’d first seem. True to form, Malcolm sweeps us into a story about one thing, and then suddenly it is about something totally unexpected yet profoundly relevant in helping us see and understand the story (and characters in it) at hand. This book has moved me toward working to hold a more gracious posture in my interactions with others and myself without sacrificing wisdom. I cannot forget the three interlocking realities he explores in this book: default to truth, the illusion of transparency, and coupling. If everyone in America could sit quietly with this information and truly consider it, we may perhaps create a kinder—and wiser— society. I’m recommending this to everyone. Although, some content is not intended for young ears. Parents be aware if you’re listening in the car with kiddos in the back.
","This is a ""should read""… Thought-provoking
I've been a member of audible since two months after its creation. This is only the second review I have ever posted with a library size numbering in the thousands and countless other books that I have returned; now I'll tell you why I am posting. I have always enjoyed Malcolm Gladwell's books so I was a bit apprehensive because I had read a few notable book reviewers reviews on this most recent publication. Therefore my mindset going into the book was cautious tending towards a negative perspective. I almost stopped reading after the first few chapters as I really could not buy into the perspective and underlying assumptions being posited. Nonetheless, I could not dismiss them out of hand and given Mr. Gladwell has been, for the most part, in his writing apolitical I pressed forward and glad I did. By the time I ended the book I can say this, regardless of your political bend this should leave you with some thought-provoking questions about society, our governmental structures, and how we view one another. The sophomoric approaches pontificated by politicians offering some law that will resolve all things is ""magical thinking"". The currents social drumbeat to see others outside your circles ['strangers' as defined by Mr. Gladwell] as threats and believe we can discern their intentions and motivations better than they can themselves are factual states of being in our time. 'If you don't agree with me therefore you must be evil' mindset is not helping any of us to understand another. Given the thought-provoking postulates of this book I wonder if we would come together as a nation if faced with, God forbid, another 9/11 event as we once did just a short few years ago. I hope you take the time to read the book. If you do decide to read the book I hope you'll set aside your own presuppositions and hear out Mr. Gladwell. I don't endorse all he has put forward but I applaud him for identifying and articulating clearly a problem we all face."

A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment","To make the journey into The Power of Now you need to leave your analytical mind and its false created self, the ego, behind. Access to the Now is everywhere - in the body, the silence, and the space all around you. These are the keys to enter a state of inner peace. They can be used to bring you into the Now, the present moment, where problems do not exist. It is here you find your joy and are able to embrace your true self. It is here you discover that you are already complete and perfect.
Although the journey is challenging, Eckhart Tolle offers simple language in a question and answer format. The words themselves are the signposts to guide you on your journey. There are new discoveries to be made along the way: you are not your mind, you can find your way out of psychological pain, authentic human power is found by surrendering to the Now. When you become fully present and accepting of what is, you open yourself to the transforming experience of The Power of Now.

","Consciousness Altering
This book caused me to realize how much my mind (ego) is generally in control of me. I had studied a number of meditative teachings, and already had the ideas in my head, but it was this book that catalyzed a clear transformation in me. There were moments where Tolle's voice (as the narrator) caused me to observe my own presence. My mind wrestled with the book, and at several points it wanted to toss the book aside, dismissing it as new-age spiritual hoo-ha (and there may be points where you try to dismiss it this way, also). But in retrospect, as I live my life, it is impossible to ignore the essential truth that Tolle has put words to. Slowly, the moments are increasing where I feel liberated from my mind's patterns of control and obsession with past/future. This was one of the most powerful books I have encountered.

","Eckhart Tolle's work, The Power of Now, is filled with wisdom, inspiration, and practical advice from beginning to end. He shows clearly how progress in the evolution of human consciousness is absolutely necessary for survival of life on this planet, and that it is up to each one of us to change our perception of the world in which we live if that progress is to take place. Tolle also shows how our tendency to dwell in the past and future obscures the present moment. In so doing, we fail to see what is necessary right now, thus we make wrong choices and decisions which lead to untold suffering for self and others. This work is a recipe for true happiness and if everyone followed the advice contained therein the world would be a happier place to live in. I have listened to it so many times now I have lost count. If I were shipwrecked on a desert island and I could take only one book, this would be it!"

Please keep an open mind as you listen. Don’t try to over analyze the message. If this is your first book on this kind of topic, there’s a slight chance the message might not be received in its entirety. Understand how the human mind works, how it interacts, and how it affects you throughout your day first, and then you’ll be able to get the most out of this book","Fabulous!
Okay, I love Tolle, Dyer, Chodron, Chopra, Ruiz, Byron Katie, and many others, and that won't change. But for the clearest explanation of how to disregard that 'nut' running commentary in my head, this book wins hands down. It is funny, I mean oh so, 'oh my goodness of course' belly laugh funny, and sensible and simple. I love simple. If you really want to understand who 'you' are...the real you behind the insanity, this is a great book. I found the narrator to be fine, not perfect but I had no problem listening to him. Listened all the way through first day and started over."

Burn Fat, Heal Inflammation, and Eat like the High-Performing Human You Were Meant to Be","Break the rules, not the fast with world-renowned biohacker and New York Times best-selling author Dave Asprey.

For more than a decade, the Bulletproof founder Dave Asprey has shared his unique point of view and expertise to help fans become the best versions of themselves. From living longer to getting smarter, maximizing performance to practicing mindfulness, Dave’s followers look to him for his take on the most effective techniques to become healthier and more powerful than most doctors think is possible. 

Asprey has been fasting for years, long before it gained widespread popularity, and if you’re a fan of Bulletproof coffee and The Bulletproof Diet, you have been enjoying some of the benefits of Intermittent Fasting too.

In Fast This Way, Dave asks listeners to forget everything they think they know about the ancient practice and takes them on a journey through cutting-edge science to examine the ways novice fasters and Intermittent Fasting loyalists can up-end their relationship with food and upgrade their fasting game beyond calorie restriction.  

What IF eating the right foods at the right time can actually enhance your fast? What IF how you work out and sleep could trick your body into thinking you are fasting? What IF it were easy to skip a meal, or two, or three? What IF fasting is different for women, can be personalized to your genes, and can impact your mental health? What IF all fasts could be created equal?

Fast This Way is a compelling lesson through the latest thinking on fasting and gives listeners the manual and toolkit to make the most of their fasts and their personal biology.  ","Good read even if you already fast
I have passed through many of the same fasting and diet strategies and fads as the author. Over the past 3 years I have gradually started fasting because nothing i had tried seemed to help me sustainably manage my weight, energy level and mental focus. Orthodox strategies all failed for me despite reasonable compliance.. i am a practicing physician and surgeon who at times has to discuss obesity and weight management with patients. How could I have conviction and credibility with patients when as hard as I tried I was failing. Several colleagues told me about their success with fasting, 5/2 diets and intermittent fasting. The physiologic basis for fasting is proven. I started slowly but stuck with it and have felt good and often great, and steadily lost weight. I got this book because I wanted to get further personal motivation and have a really good stump speech for my patients. Dave has filled in a lot of details for me. This book is not a heavy-handed rigid unsustainable approach but rather a comprehensive gentle, realistically achievable description about how to transform how one thinks about and interacts with food to get the best out of life. If you struggle with being overweight and/or fatigue and you think you can't possibly fast, or truly need to eat 3 meals a day let Dave coach you to a bunch of new perspectives.

","Life Changing
Wow - this hit home for me in a way no other book has. The style, ease, and story telling wrapped by data just sticks. I am inspired to fast for clarity, fast from weasel words and mostly fast from hate. Read the whole book and you will not only understand but be inspired as well."

The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find - and Keep - Love","""A groundbreaking book that redefines what it means to be in a relationship."" (John Gray, PhD., best-selling author of Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus)

We already rely on science to tell us what to eat, when to exercise, and how long to sleep. Why not use science to help us improve our relationships? In this revolutionary book, psychiatrist and neuroscientist Dr. Amir Levine and Rachel Heller scientifically explain why some people seem to navigate relationships effortlessly, while others struggle.

Discover how an understanding of adult attachment - the most advanced relationship science in existence today - can help us find and sustain love. Pioneered by psychologist John Bowlby in the 1950s, the field of attachment posits that each of us behaves in relationships in one of three distinct ways:

Anxious people are often preoccupied with their relationships and tend to worry about their partner's ability to love them back  
Avoidant people equate intimacy with a loss of independence and constantly try to minimize closeness.  
Secure people feel comfortable with intimacy and are usually warm and loving.
Attached guides listeners in determining what attachment style they and their mate (or potential mate) follow, offering a road map for building stronger, more fulfilling connections with the people they love.

*Includes a PDF of the attachment style questionnaire

My main complaints about this book are that it's not very inclusive of folks who practice ethical non-monogamy or polyamory. And I disagree with some small parts of what they say. However, the main information in this book is incredibly helpful in all relationships, even if this is focused on romantic and sexual ones. Helped me realize some things about myself, and I will recommend it to others. Essential reading for anyone dating in the modern age.","Wow

Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman's seminal studies in behavioral psychology, behavioral economics, and happiness studies have influenced numerous other authors, including Steven Pinker and Malcolm Gladwell. In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman at last offers his own, first book for the general public. It is a lucid and enlightening summary of his life's work. It will change the way you think about thinking. 

Two systems drive the way we think and make choices, Kahneman explains: System One is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System Two is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Examining how both systems function within the mind, Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities as well as the biases of fast thinking and the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and our choices. Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, he shows where we can trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking, contrasting the two-system view of the mind with the standard model of the rational economic agent. 

Kahneman's singularly influential work has transformed cognitive psychology and launched the new fields of behavioral economics and happiness studies. In this path-breaking book, Kahneman shows how the mind works, and offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and personal lives - and how we can guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. ","A tour de force... Kahneman’s book is a must read for anyone interested in either human behavior or investing. He clearly shows that while we like to think of ourselves as rational in our decision making, the truth is we are subject to many biases. At least being aware of them will give you a better chance of avoiding them, or at least making fewer of them.” (Larry Swedroe, CBS News)

“A major intellectual event... The work of Kahneman and Tversky was a crucial pivot point in the way we see ourselves.” (David Brooks, The New York Times)

“[Thinking, Fast and Slow] is wonderful, of course. To anyone with the slightest interest in the workings of his own mind, it is so rich and fascinating that any summary would seem absurd.” (Michael Lewis, Vanity Fair)","Wow. Academic at times, but very thought-provoking
The subject line really says it all. It's not a book I would recommend for everyone---it does become a little academic and dense at times in it's presentation---but I think I found myself talking about this book to others more than any other book I've read the last few years. It was VERY thought-provoking and really had me reflecting on it's content as I walked around and dealt with the rest of my life. I know I'm going to carry many key ideas away from it and into the future.

Honestly, while I respect and enjoy Malcolm Gladwell and those types of books, THIS is the book that I've been looking for!

12 Revolutionary Strategies to Nurture Your Child's Developing Mind","The authors of No-Drama Discipline and The Yes Brain explain the new science of how a child’s brain is wired and how it matures in this pioneering, practical book.

“Simple, smart, and effective solutions to your child’s struggles.” -Harvey Karp, M.D.

In this pioneering, practical book, Daniel J. Siegel, neuropsychiatrist and author of the bestselling Mindsight, and parenting expert Tina Payne Bryson offer a revolutionary approach to child rearing with twelve key strategies that foster healthy brain development, leading to calmer, happier children. The authors explain - and make accessible - the new science of how a child’s brain is wired and how it matures. The “upstairs brain,” which makes decisions and balances emotions, is under construction until the mid-twenties. And especially in young children, the right brain and its emotions tend to rule over the logic of the left brain. No wonder kids throw tantrums, fight, or sulk in silence. By applying these discoveries to everyday parenting, you can turn any outburst, argument, or fear into a chance to integrate your child’s brain and foster vital growth. 

Complete with age-appropriate strategies for dealing with day-to-day struggles, The Whole-Brain Child shows you how to cultivate healthy emotional and intellectual development so that your children can lead balanced, meaningful, and connected lives.","A very helpful listen!
This book focuses on promoting the psycho-social development of your child(ren). Which, in my opinion, is of vital importance in today's culture. If you get this book thinking it will help you earn your kid a few more IQ points or improve her math grades, you'll have to take a step back and look at the big picture. Confident, secure, and articulate people are more likely to perform to their full potential in every aspect of their lives, than people who hold themselves back. This book provided useful tools that I have been able to apply successfully with my 3 year old son, as well as tools I am keeping in mind for when he is older. I highly recommend this book for anyone with children up through pre-adolescence. I think they have a separate book for the teen years.

There is a male and female narrator who switch back and forth reading sections. The female narrator doesn't have a good voice for it, although she gives a flawless performance. But the pacing is fine. The sections that are meant for young kids are a little annoying to hear, and the appendix is a snooze. But otherwise the performance does not detract from the book.","Info is great, narration is horrible
The information on the book was groundbreaking for me, however the narration was incredibly hard to follow: it felt like listening to a 5th grader read through a textbook. I really enjoyed the tips, the science behind them, and the overall concept. I really just wish authors would stop reading their own books.

Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams","The first sleep book by a leading scientific expert - Professor Matthew Walker, director of UC Berkeley's Sleep and Neuroimaging Lab - reveals his groundbreaking exploration of sleep, explaining how we can harness its transformative power to change our lives for the better.

Sleep is one of the most important but least understood aspects of our life, wellness, and longevity. Until very recently, science had no answer to the question of why we sleep, or what good it served, or why we suffer such devastating health consequences when we don't sleep. Compared to the other basic drives in life - eating, drinking, and reproducing - the purpose of sleep remained elusive.

But an explosion of scientific discoveries in the last 20 years has shed new light on this fundamental aspect of our lives. Now, preeminent neuroscientist and sleep expert Matthew Walker gives us a new understanding of the vital importance of sleep and dreaming. Among so many other things, within the brain, sleep enriches our ability to learn, memorize, and make logical decisions. It recalibrates our emotions, restocks our immune system, fine-tunes our metabolism, and regulates our appetite. Dreaming mollifies painful memories and creates a virtual reality space in which the brain melds past and present knowledge to inspire creativity.

Walker answers important questions about sleep: How do caffeine and alcohol affect sleep? What really happens during REM sleep? Why do our sleep patterns change across a lifetime? How do common sleep aids affect us, and can they do long-term damage? Charting cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs and synthesizing decades of research and clinical practice, Walker explains how we can harness sleep to improve learning, mood, and energy levels; regulate hormones; prevent cancer, Alzheimer's, and diabetes; slow the effects of aging; increase longevity; enhance the education and lifespan of our children, and boost the efficiency, success, and productivity of our businesses. Clear-eyed, fascinating, and immensely accessible, Why We Sleep is the crucial account on sleep that will forever change listeners' minds on the subject.","I recommend this to EVERYONE
I first noticed Why We Sleep on Audible's homepage under &quot;New in Non-Fiction&quot; and clicked on it simply because I saw it was narrated by one of my favorite narrators, Steve West. The subtitle &quot;Unlocking the power of sleep and dreams&quot; makes this sound like it would be full of watered down science and generic advice about getting a good night's sleep or interpreting your dreams. That is NOT what this book is, thankfully. Matthew Walker presents study after study explaining why we need sleep for every aspect of our lives (to prevent disease, to help remember things, to look more attractive, etc.). I was fascinated for all 14 hours of this book. I've recommended it to every person I know, because the content of the book is just so IMPORTANT. The next time I hear someone say, &quot;Oh, I only need 5 hours of sleep a night,&quot; I will tell them how wrong they are and shove this book in their face. Seriously, everyone needs to READ THIS BOOK!!! Our society holds some really erroneous beliefs about sleep, from how much you should be getting a night, to whether you really have insomnia (you probably don't). Walker addresses everything you ever wanted to know about sleep and more in this book. I will be listening to this again soon.
","Wow, should have read this years ago...
It is amazing how Matt Walker takes these new studies and forms them into data we can learn from. Data that is not dry and mind-numbing but interesting and wants you to listen to sections over to really soak in that information. After reading this book and am much more driven to protect my sleep time and keep a schedule. And I must say that my life daily stability is much more even, that my pulls from memory and learning is becoming better even though I am aging and that effect on memories. So I encourage you, that if you are reading this, to get this book and value yourself enough to take this topic seriously so you protect something that you can not get back.

12 More Rules for Life","The companion volume to 12 Rules for Life offers further guidance on the perilous path of modern life.

In 12 Rules for Life, clinical psychologist and celebrated professor at Harvard and the University of Toronto Dr. Jordan B. Peterson helped millions impose order on the chaos of their lives. Now, in this bold sequel, Peterson delivers 12 more lifesaving principles for resisting the exhausting toll that our desire to order the world inevitably takes.

In a time when the human will increasingly imposes itself over every sphere of life - from our social structures to our emotional states - Peterson warns that too much security is dangerous. What’s more, he offers strategies for overcoming the cultural, scientific, and psychological forces causing us to tend toward tyranny, and teaches us how to rely instead on our instinct to find meaning and purpose, even - and especially - when we find ourselves powerless.

While chaos, in excess, threatens us with instability and anxiety, unchecked order can petrify us into submission. Beyond Order provides a call to balance these two fundamental principles of reality itself and guides us along the straight and narrow path that divides them.",,

The Radical Choice to Not Drink in a Culture Obsessed with Alcohol","""You don’t know how much you need this book, or maybe you do. Either way, it will save your life."" (Melissa Hartwig Urban, Whole30 co-founder and CEO)

We live in a world obsessed with drinking. We drink at baby showers and work events, brunch and book club, graduations and funerals. Yet no one ever questions alcohol’s ubiquity - in fact, the only thing ever questioned is why someone doesn’t drink. It is a qualifier for belonging and if you don’t imbibe, you are considered an anomaly. As a society, we are obsessed with health and wellness, yet we uphold alcohol as some kind of magic elixir, though it is anything but.

When Holly Whitaker decided to seek help after one too many benders, she embarked on a journey that led not only to her own sobriety, but revealed the insidious role alcohol plays in our society and in the lives of women in particular. What’s more, she could not ignore the ways that alcohol companies were targeting women, just as the tobacco industry had successfully done generations before. Fueled by her own emerging feminism, she also realized that the predominant systems of recovery are archaic, patriarchal, and ineffective for the unique needs of women and other historically oppressed people - who don’t need to lose their egos and surrender to a male concept of God, as the tenets of Alcoholics Anonymous state, but who need to cultivate a deeper understanding of their own identities and take control of their lives.

When Holly found an alternate way out of her own addiction, she felt a calling to create a sober community with resources for anyone questioning their relationship with drinking, so that they might find their way as well. Her resultant feminine-centric recovery program focuses on getting at the root causes that lead people to overindulge and provides the tools necessary to break the cycle of addiction, showing us what is possible when we remove alcohol and destroy our belief system around it.

Written in a relatable voice that is honest and witty, Quit Like a Woman is at once a groundbreaking look at drinking culture and a road map to cutting out alcohol in order to live our best lives without the crutch of intoxication. You will never look at drinking the same way again.","An unflinching examination of how our drinking culture hurts women and a gorgeous memoir of how one woman healed herself. It will change your relationship with alcohol - and it has the power to change your relationship with your entire life."" (Glennon Doyle, number one New York Times best-selling author of Love Warrior and founder of Together Rising)

""A funny, fast-paced, and bracingly candid dispatch from the realm of the self-actualized, but Holly Whitaker is no polished model of self-help evangelism, nor is her memoir-manifesto selling a one-size-fits-all solution. Her story is a messy human one and all the more convincing that sobriety is a feminist issue."" (Melissa Febos, author of Whip Smart and Abandon Me)

""As a culture, we have a weird and often dysfunctional relationship with alcohol. This thoughtful, moving book will help a lot of people get to a healthier place."" (Johann Hari, author of Chasing the Scream and Lost Connections)","If you question your drinking in anyway, I highly recommend.
This is a lot to unpack, but done very, very well. I’ve been craving a study of the history of alcohol in the US, its place in our culture and the science of alcohol. I was thrilled to find out the author was writing this, because I enjoyed her blog writing back when it was Hip Sobriety. There is a lot of information out there on this subject as medical views in alcohol are slowly changing (see WHO) and more people are “sober curious”, but this packages all of that so well. This was well researched and also asks some very poignant questions. I stumbled upon the author three or four years ago through her blog, and thought she was on to something and liked her writing style. I’m happy to see that she continued down a path of exploring why we even drink in the first place and why we are so obsessed with alcohol as a culture. This is also a great push to recovery if you are a woman struggling with alcohol and are open and ready to hear some truth. This book is like having a deep dive of her blog all in one spot. I read Holly’s blog back in the day when I knew alcohol just had to go, and it was truly the first thing that ever made real sense. This book would have been wonderful to have back then, but it doesn’t hurt to hear again and reaffirms that a holistic approach to sobriety works, because it did for me. FYI, you don’t have to hit some crazy “rock bottom” to question the role of alcohol in your life."

A Therapist, HER Therapist, and Our Lives Revealed","An irresistibly addictive tour of the human condition."" (Kirkus, starred review)

""Rarely have I read a book that challenged me to see myself in an entirely new light, and was at the same time laugh-out-loud funny and utterly absorbing."" (Katie Couric)

""This is a daring, delightful, and transformative book."" (Arianna Huffington, founder, Huffington Post and founder & CEO, Thrive Global)

""Wise, warm, smart, and funny. You must read this book."" (Susan Cain, New York Times best-selling author of Quiet)

From a New York Times best-selling author, psychotherapist, and national advice columnist, a hilarious, thought-provoking, and surprising new book that takes us behind the scenes of a therapist's world - where her patients are looking for answers (and so is she).  

One day, Lori Gottlieb is a therapist who helps patients in her Los Angeles practice. The next, a crisis causes her world to come crashing down. Enter Wendell, the quirky but seasoned therapist in whose of­fice she suddenly lands. With his balding head, cardigan, and khakis, he seems to have come straight from Therapist Central Casting. Yet he will turn out to be anything but.  

As Gottlieb explores the inner chambers of her patients' lives - a self-absorbed Hollywood producer, a young newlywed diagnosed with a terminal illness, a senior citizen threatening to end her life on her birthday if nothing gets better, and a 20-something who can't stop hooking up with the wrong guys - she finds that the questions they are struggling with are the very ones she is now bringing to Wendell.  

With startling wisdom and humor, Gottlieb invites us into her world as both clinician and patient, examining the truths and fictions we tell ourselves and others as we teeter on the tightrope between love and desire, meaning and mortality, guilt and redemption, terror and courage, hope and change.  

Maybe You Should Talk to Someone is revolutionary in its candor, offering a deeply personal yet universal tour of our hearts and minds and providing the rarest of gifts: a boldly revealing portrait of what it means to be human and a disarmingly funny and illuminating account of our own mysterious lives and our power to transform them.","Brittany Pressley performs this audiobook at a fast pace that will be familiar to listeners who live in large, bustling cities. But she knows how to moderate her energy for the tender sections, and her overall performance sounds authentic, conversational, and true to the core intentions of the author's story....Portrayed by Pressley, [the author] also sounds like someone you know, which makes her observations and insights all the more accessible.",

The Story of Success","In this stunning new book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of ""outliers"" - the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high achievers different? His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.

Brilliant and entertaining, Outliers is a landmark work that will simultaneously delight and illuminate.

","Should be named - Excuses
I'm 1 starring this book due to the authors opinion. In his closing statements of the Epilogue, he even states that outliers are not outliers. The author's opinion is the left-leaning idea of privilege, that some of us are dealt better cards than others and that's that. For example, he starts off the book by talking about the birthdays of professional hockey players in Canada and how league cut offs when growing up determine that. The ""outliers"" are pro hockey players and the majority of pro hockey players are born between January and April. The focus is on those ""lucky"" individuals born between January and April. He makes it sound like you should be defeated if you were born December 31st, because you will never be a pro hockey player by way of a rigged system against you. But, what about that pro hockey player who WAS born on December 31st? What about the outliers of outliers, who succeeded in despite of ""adversity."" The author is silent. When you look for privilege, we all have something. The author uses this as a cop-out for defining a ""lucky"" class and an ""unfortunate"" class. His solution is an idealistic dystopian future. I wish this book had been a book about true outliers, those rare people who overcame adversity and excelled with the odds against them. Instead, it was a liberal rant complaining like a small child that someone else got it a little bit better.","Interesting
This was a pretty interesting book. I don't agree with all of the reasoning, but it's an interesting theory.

The one downside to this book is that if you're looking for motivation, it might work the opposite effect.

This book is about how luck and certain circumstances make you more likely to be successful such as your birthdate, ethnicity, and religion.

If you easily see your circumstances as beyond your control, you may read this book and feel disheartened that you're not lucky or have the right circumstances to be successful.

I believe luck is part of it, but drive and ambition are also important too. You DO have the power to alter your circumstances, even if you've not been given special advantages."

In Art of Seduction, Greene returns with a new instruction audiobook on the most subtle, elusive, and effective form of power because seduction isn't really about sex. It's about manipulating other people's greatest weakness: their desire for pleasure.

What does it take to accomplish the impossible? What does it take to shatter our limitations, exceed our expectations, and turn our biggest dreams into our most recent achievements? We are capable of so much more than we know - that’s the message at the core of The Art of Impossible. 

Building upon cutting-edge neuroscience and more than 20 years of research, best-selling author, peak performance expert and executive director of the Flow Research Collective, Steven Kotler lays out a blueprint for extreme performance improvement. If you want to aim high, here is the playbook to make it happen!

I own a ton of self-development books and books on performance. I can honestly say that this is the most powerful and moving among them. After picking my jaw up off the floor multiple times, I stopped listening and came here to write this review. This book in powerful in ways that have to be experienced firsthand, and it is amazing to get the feeling that the mind behind this book, has lived and practiced its contents to be able to write such a compelling and powerful guide as this one. Some books are meant to be read and appreciated. Others are meant to be lived. If you're the kind of person who realizes that there is more within you, a higher version of yourself, more potential that has thus far gone untapped, this is the right book. Thankfully it is not -- at all -- about ""rah rah"" platitudes or empty motivational boilerplate. It's a deep, thoughtful look at what superior performance is and how to live it. I was on the fence about whether to buy yet another book on performance, and I'm glad I did. This is a book that forces you to grow, expand, improve, and to think differently. Who knew that the self-development genre still had space within it for innovation and powerful and enlightening perspectives?","Super insightful last few chapters
I came directly to this book from Mapping Cloud Nine, and my only wish is that Steven Kotler narrated it himself bc I love feeling his excitement through his energetic style of speaking. Some of the book was repetitive from his others (but that’s bound to happen when talking about flow from SK); however, I found the last few chapters to be super insightful, in-depth, and practical.

Are you unable to live your romantic relationship without doubts or insecurities? Are you a slave to jealousy or terrified of abandonment? If you answered “yes” to these questions and wish to live a better relationship, then keep listening....

Anxiety is a normal human condition and a necessary part of our lives. We all have a trait of anxiety in one way or the other. In ""fight or flight mode"", fear allows us to recognize and respond to hazards. And what about couples? 

In the early stages of a relationship, people may get feelings of insecurity leading to more anxiety. You can experience worrying thoughts such as, “Does this person really like me?” “How serious is this relationship?” “Will it work out?” Usually, if you love someone deeply, and he/she breaks your heart, chances are, you will avoid being vulnerable. On a certain level, we all fear being hurt, consciously or unconsciously. Ironically, this fear tends to increase when we are getting what we want. But…good news, anxiety can be overcome and couple conflicts can be resolved!

The first sentence hit home. This is me, this is what I do! I am so scared that I am not good enough or attractive enough for him to love me. I will find something, anything to justify his actions as the reason I am not staying in the relationship. It’s his fault not mine. I didn’t even realize that I was treating him poorly. I was just reacting to what he was doing. He could not spend a minute away from me without me thinking he was cheating on me. His ex is stunning he couldn’t possibly be satisfied with a person who has a “dad bod” and is 15 years older. I was buying his love and resented him for it. I didn’t feel adequate so I tried to buy his love and attention. If I can take the risk of being rejected, I would not be the controlling partner that doesn’t allow space and a circle of friends that I am not a part of. This book is a must for all couples that have been cheated on or have self esteem issues. Love yourself, don’t let the relationship determine your value.","it explains so many trials and tribulations

How Common People Are Doing the Uncommon","The author of the New York Times best seller You Are the Placebo, as well as Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself and Evolve Your Brain, draws on research conducted at his advanced workshops since 2012 to explore how common people are doing the uncommon to transform themselves and their lives.

Demystifying the body’s seven energy centers and how you can balance them to heal

loved it. epiphany after epiphany. I've done some pretty amazing things from knowledge I've learned and applied in this book. I've been able to direct bloodflow to my cold hands when its cold out using only my thoughts and emotions. For years I've told myself I had a particular condition but I also knew it was psychological. Today I envisioned the warmth from blood flowing through my fingers and felt a strong sense of gratitude and minutes later found the numbness going away and my hands full of energy. If I'm able to almost instantly become something other than what I believed for years in 3 minutes imagine the other things can I manifest.

","Finally got through this classic
I finally opened an Audible account and first picked a book that I've had on shelf for years and even started once or twice. I remembered the written version being a little dry and repetitious. The first issue was fixed by the engaging delivery; the second issue, in an audiobook, turned out to be a virtue. A very good experience. However, in a book laden with social science references, checking the sources in an audiobook is difficult. Knowing the replication problems of psychology and social sciences, going into details of the research would be necessary to fully trust the examples. Or, you need to place total trust in the author, while keeping in mind that even Nobel laureates have been overconfident in their experiment design. But I digress. A great book, good listen. ""Click, whirr"".","Eye Opening
I listened to this book in about a week, and it's already making me perceive the world in a different way. From the guy at McDonalds who smiled when he asked if I wanted to donate a dollar to St. Jude to the man who gave my church a timeline on the purchase of an old church building because he has other ""interested parties,"" I am more aware of the compliance tactics that people inadvertently or intentionally use around me to encourage me to behave in a certain way.

I am not a doctor, nutritionist or science major. I'm just a middle-age female who has struggled with weight for the past 15 years. I have a genuine interest in biology, epigenetics, nutrition and disease prevention. I have literally read or listened to every single book published out there on those subjects. Some are good, some are bad. And all of them center around this false notion that eating the right amount or specific kinds of various macros are the key to losing weight. Don't get me wrong - some of those diets and eating plans work - in the short term. Once I even lost 30 lbs and found a love of trail running. But every single stinkin' time the weight loss would be only temporary, and it would come back on within months. I was the quintessential yo-yo dieter who people assumed went on ice cream eating binges when I definitely did not. No one ever explained set-point, or the reason why weight comes back. Dr. Fung explains the body's homeostasis so well and with such great analogies that it was like a big, bright lightbulb going off. I'm excited to begin a new journey of sustained weight loss. This time around, instead of cutting out entire food groups or focusing on macros, I bought a blood sugar monitor and will aim to lower my blood sugar and insulin levels by experimenting with the right foods and diet for me. I discovered that Greek Yogurt -- the supposed health food that almost every diet book applauds as being great for weight loss -- spikes my blood sugar (and presumably, my insulin) considerably. But a snack of Ezekiel bread and peanut butter (gasp... actual BREAD?) didn't affect my blood sugar much at all. After years of wondering if tweaking and lowering my calories by another 100 on My Fitness Pal app would help me break my plateau, I finally have real answers. (And for the record, Dr. Fung insists that answer is NO.) The narrator was fabulous, and all around I'm declaring that I don't need to listen to another weight loss book ever again. This is a God-send!"

The New Psychology of Success","The updated edition of the book that has changed millions of lives with its insights into the growth mind-set.

After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, PhD, discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mind-set. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mind-set - those who believe that abilities are fixed - are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mind-set - those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment.

In this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mind-set and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mind-set. She also expands the mind-set concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mind-set, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love - to transform their lives and your own.

Praise for Mindset:

“A good book is one whose advice you believe. A great book is one whose advice you follow. This is a book that can change your life, as its ideas have changed mine.” (Robert J. Sternberg, co-author of Teaching for Wisdom, Intelligence, Creativity, and Success)

“An essential read for parents, teachers [and] coaches...as well as for those who would like to increase their own feelings of success and fulfillment.” (Library Journal, starred review)

“Everyone should read this book.” (Chip Heath and Dan Heath, authors of Made to Stick)

“One of the most influential books ever about motivation.” (Po Bronson, author of NurtureShock)

“If you manage people or are a parent, which is a form of managing people, drop everything and read Mindset.” (Guy Kawasaki, author of The Art of the Start 2.0)
","Enlightening but redundant
This book was extremely enlightening and has really helped solidify some issues for me, however the majority of the book was dedicated to explaining the concept of the two mindsets rather than talking about how to cultivate the growth mindset. The language used to describe the ""fixed"" mind set was often judgmental, and as someone who struggles with that, it was a little off putting. However, if you can put the negativity of the language aside, there is helpful information. I wish there was more information and explanation of how to change mindset once you've identified that you have the ""bad"" fixed mindset.

","great use of time
Yes the reader was robotic for the first 25 percent of the book, but then she settled in and became human. There are so many ideas that I will apply immediately to my life personally and professionally. This was well worth the purchase, now I am familiar with the concept and can go back to the hard copy to flag some ideas.

","Where’s the beef? Book is like trying to find a needle in a hat stack.
The author has some good information in this book, but it takes a long time to find. I realized that the author follows a pattern. Here is the pattern. Let’s say you want to learn about how to thinly slice tomatoes. The author would do the following: 1) 15 minutes saying that you are capable of slicing tomatoes like a pro. 2) explains that you were taught incorrectly how to slice tomatoes 3) shares some examples of when he has served thinly sliced tomatoes and everyone was amazed at how thin they were (but he doesn’t tell you how to do it). 4) explains what a tomato is and what a beautiful thing a thin sliced tomato can be. 5) tells you again that you have the power to thinly slice tomatoes. 6) Briefly tells you actually how to slice the tomato (here is the needle in the haystack). Doesn’t tell you too much and instead tells you to go to his website for more details and resources. 7) Tells you how thinly sliced tomatoes are amazing...again. 8) shares how he’s gone to Fortune 500 companies to help them thinly slice tomatoes.

Activate Your Full Human Potential","The only definitive work authored by Wim Hof on his powerful method for realizing our physical and spiritual potential.

Narrated by Olympic and world champion short track speed skater Apolo Anton Ohno.

“This method is very simple, very accessible, and endorsed by science. Anybody can do it, and there is no dogma, only acceptance. Only freedom.” (Wim Hof)

Wim Hof has a message for each of us: “You can literally do the impossible. You can overcome disease, improve your mental health and physical performance, and even control your physiology so you can thrive in any stressful situation.” With The Wim Hof Method, this trailblazer of human potential shares a method that anyone can use - young or old, sick or healthy - to supercharge their capacity for strength, vitality, and happiness.

Wim has become known as “The Iceman” for his astounding physical feats, such as spending hours in freezing water and running barefoot marathons over deserts and ice fields. Yet his most remarkable achievement is not any record-breaking performance - it is the creation of a method that thousands of people have used to transform their lives.

In his gripping and passionate style, Wim shares his story and the three pillars of his method:

Breath - His unique practices to change your body chemistry, infuse yourself with energy, and focus your mind
Cold - Safe, controlled, shock-free practices for using cold exposure to enhance your cardiovascular system and awaken your body’s untapped strength
Mindset - Build your willpower, inner clarity, sensory awareness, and innate joyfulness in the miracle of living
Wim Hof is a man on a mission: to transform the way we live by reminding us of our true power and purpose. “This is how we will change the world, one soul at a time,” Wim says. “We alter the collective consciousness by awakening to our own boundless potential. We are limited only by the depth of our imagination and the strength of our conviction.”","Outstanding book
This book I have been waiting for. I started practicing the WHM in July of this year 2020. At 58 years old I was looking for a way to get both mentally and physically fit. The WHM has helped me become more relaxed, and more focused. The method of breath work, cold showers and mindset are simply stated FABULOUS!! I have lost 23 pounds and have not missed a day of doing this since i started. I am currently in the second week of the ten week video course. The book helps explain the methods and the research and science that backs it. I git the book today and finished it today. I am sure it will be a resource I will go to often as I continue on this journey to better health and performance.","You need this
This book will help you in many ways Most importantly it will open your mind to your own greatness BREATHE MF BREATHE
Breathe MFer!
At first I was a bit disappointed that Wim didn't read this book, however Noho was amazing! Can't wait to listen again! Thank You Wim! Just what we need as humans. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!!

The Cold, The breath, commitment ... wow
Cold, breath and commitment has extremely changed my lifestyle and I have leveled up tremendously in all areas of my life. I don’t need energy drinks anymore and i don’t need to layer up when it’s cold. Such a life changing book and I will be doing it for the rest of my life. Thank you Wim for this.

The Surprising New Science That Will Transform Your Sex Life","An essential exploration of why and how women's sexuality works - based on groundbreaking research and brain science - that will radically transform your sex life into one filled with confidence and joy.

Researchers have spent the last decade trying to develop a ""pink pill"" for women to function like Viagra does for men. So where is it? Well, for reasons this book makes crystal clear, that pill will never exist - but as a result of the research that's gone into it, scientists in the last few years have learned more about how women's sexuality works than we ever thought possible, and Come as You Are explains it all
Sex is a natural part of life, but it can sometimes feel like a taboo subject—which is a bit preposterous, considering how sex is linked to politics, gender, mental health, literature, and how we navigate the world. This list of the best sex-positive nonfiction books (with a few provocative fiction titles thrown in for good measure) is all about exploring the intricacies of sex with intelligence, humor, and insight. Discover these cross-genre voices.","Awesome book Very informative and enlightening
Full disclosure: I'm a guy...

That said; this book is great. It really helped me to understand and rethink how my partners mind and body may feel and react to stimuli... contrary to what I previously ""assumed"" or was fought.

thank you Emily Nagoski for putting this out there","More interesting than I thought
Would you listen to Come as You Are again? Why?

Probably not all the way through (I bookmarked few spots thought); there were handful of very interesting concepts, which I have now absorbed.

Any additional comments?

As I started listening to this book I thought: ""Oh, this is a book for women"" (I'm male), but decided to continue listening, and I'm glad I did. Yes, it is primarily written for women, but there were several general concepts about human sexuality (which are also applicable to men) I was unaware of. And, being a straight guy, it was good to learn about some some central factors in female sexuality, too. :-) Arousal nonconcordance, the dual control model, the extent of the effect of the context, what Emily refers to as ""the little monitors"" (maybe not a scientific term?), and the criterion velocity were all partially or entirely new information to me. It's always interesting to learn how there are various systems in the human body that have been mapped out and understood to this extent. Yes, it was definitely worth a listen; I'd say this is one of those books that would make a big difference in many people's lives if everyone would read it at around the age of 20."

The Power of Passion and Perseverance","In this must-listen book for anyone striving to succeed, pioneering psychologist Angela Duckworth shows parents, educators, students, and businesspeople - both seasoned and new - that the secret to outstanding achievement is not talent but a focused persistence called ""grit"".

Why do some people succeed and others fail? Sharing new insights from her landmark research on grit, MacArthur ""genius"" Angela Duckworth explains why talent is hardly a guarantor of success. Rather, other factors can be even more crucial, such as identifying our passions and following through on our commitments.

Drawing on her own powerful story as the daughter of a scientist who frequently bemoaned her lack of smarts, Duckworth describes her winding path through teaching, business consulting, and neuroscience, which led to the hypothesis that what really drives success is not genius but a special blend of passion and long-term perseverance. As a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Duckworth created her own ""character lab"" and set out to test her theory.

Here, she takes listeners into the field to visit teachers working in some of the toughest schools, cadets struggling through their first days at West Point, and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee. She also mines fascinating insights from history and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance. Finally, she shares what she's learned from interviewing dozens of high achievers - from J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to the cartoon editor of The New Yorker to Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll.

Winningly personal, insightful, and even life changing, Grit is a book about what goes through your head when you fall down and how that - not talent or luck - makes all the difference.","Lazy rehash of accomplished authors
This author doesn't ""have a theory."" She so shamelessly piggybacks on other more accomplished authors I'm a bit annoyed her book is so popular. To save yourself the trouble, I will tell you to rather read the books that this book is based on: Peak (deliberate practice) The Power of Habit Mindset (the masterpiece)

","A 9 hour commencement address
I'll repeat what a couple of other reviewers have said, it took ""grit"" to finish what probably could have been discussed efficiently with statistics and examples in 90 minutes or less. While ""Grit"" offers some useful observations on power of persistence in exceptionally successful people, it comes across as a 9 1/2 hour affirmation of multiple the aphorisms on determination (e.g. Genius: 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration). While the author cites some studies and field work, I'm unconvinced that she used test populations and statistical sampling that hold up to analytic rigor. At the beginning of the book, the author overstates the statistical merit of the grit study to predict a cadet's potential to complete ""Beast Barracks"" at West Point and while she does somewhat temper her conclusion near the end of the book, it comes very late and almost off-hand. Finally, I did not value the author's continual inclusion of herself and family to support her observations and work. While these anecdotes are interesting in their own right and make the author relatable, they are also self-serving and call into question her objectivity. I think largest deficiency in the book is not fully exploring goal setting in relation to grit. There is some time spent on this topic, maybe 45 minutes to an hour, which is really not enough in comparison to the rest of the volume.

The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers","For the last two years, I've interviewed more than 200 world-class performers for my podcast, The Tim Ferriss Show. The guests range from super celebs (Jamie Foxx, Arnold Schwarzenegger, etc.) and athletes (icons of powerlifting, gymnastics, surfing, etc.) to legendary Special Operations commanders and black-market biochemists. For most of my guests, it’s the first time they’ve agreed to a two-to-three-hour interview. This unusual depth has helped make The Tim Ferriss Show the first business/interview podcast to pass 100 million downloads. 

""This book contains the distilled tools, tactics, and 'inside baseball' you won't find anywhere else. It also includes new tips from past guests, and life lessons from new 'guests' you haven't met.   

""What makes the show different is a relentless focus on actionable details. This is reflected in the questions. For example: What do these people do in the first 60 minutes of each morning? What do their workout routines look like, and why? What books have they gifted most to other people? What are the biggest wastes of time for novices in their field? What supplements do they take on a daily basis? 

""I don't view myself as an interviewer. I view myself as an experimenter. If I can't test something and replicate results in the messy reality of everyday life, I'm not interested.""

""Everything [in this audiobook] has been vetted, explored, and applied to my own life in some fashion. I've used dozens of the tactics and philosophies in high-stakes negotiations, high-risk environments, or large business dealings. The lessons have made me millions of dollars and saved me years of wasted effort and frustration. 

""I created this book, my ultimate notebook of high-leverage tools, for myself. It's changed my life, and I hope the same for you."" ","If I could sum it up: too much of a good thing
Despite this less-than-stellar review, I actually am a fan of Ferris’. I absolutely loved “The 4-Hour Workweek,” I listen to his podcast a decent amount, and I’ve read a lot of his stuff online. It always pains me to leave less-than-positive reviews for folks I look up to, but I think a few points need to be made here. As to not harp on the negative, however, I’ll start with what’s good about this book. The Good: -There are so many high-profile and successful folks (the “titans”) interviewed in this work. Tony Robbins, Seth Rogan, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Whitney Cummings, etc. It’s awesome to hear the perspectives of such successful people. -The book provides countless life hacks, tips, and tricks for the reader to digest and implement. -In the final hour of the audiobook, Ferris has a section on depression that’s really raw and real. Though mental health is something that’s very important to me, specifically, I think almost anyone would find this section moving. The Bad: -The book is way too long. This is something I disliked about “The 4-Hour Body” and “The 4-Hour Chef” as well. Writing is just as much about what you leave in as what you leave out. It’s just my opinion, but I think the deluge of information here feels slightly lazy, which is a shame, because I know just how much work must’ve gone into this book. -This is where I make myself laugh, but there really is too much good information here. This plays into my previous point. At the end of it, I was frankly overwhelmed — though I had just finished a 700+ page book, I still had a long list of other books and movies to check out thanks to the recommendations made here. I was hoping this one would be a “be-all-end-all” synthesization of good content — not a journey into even more of it. -In my mind, the formatting and editing miss the mark here. I know Ferris says to jump around and treat the book as an encyclopedia, but I just don’t think the content allows for that. If I buy a book filled with interviews from the world’s best, I’m probably going to read every interview. Jumping around in this one is also difficult because the interviews are not categorized by subject. That is, you can’t jump to the “wellness” part of the book; you can only make guesses as to which interviewees will talk about the subjects you’re interested in, and skip there. -There are many narrators of the audiobook, which can make listening confusing at times. Again, as to not harp on the negative, I think I’ll probably leave my points at the above; you likely see my argument by now. Turning back to the positive, however, there is some seriously good content here. The problem, however, as I’ve mentioned, is that you have to wade through so much other content to get to the stuff you’re most interested in. I saw a review on Amazon that recommended that Ferris come out with a new edition of this book, one that catalogs the information better and provides a useful index. I totally agree. I also don’t think it would’ve hurt to have broken this book into multiple titles. I don’t really see myself revisiting this book, but what I definitely will do is revisit Ferris’ podcast and his breakout hit, “The 4-Hour Workweek.” That book was one of my favorites when I read it — I think I’m overdue to jump back into it. So, while I can’t say that I fully recommend this one, I also can’t say that I don’t recommend it. If you are going to jump in, I just suggest that you buckle up and drive slowly. It’s a long ride. -Brian Sachetta Author of “Get Out of Your Head”","Disappointed-much bullshit mixed with legit advice

The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It","An award-winning psychologist reveals the hidden power of our inner voice and shows how we can harness it to live a healthier, more satisfying, and more productive life.

“This book is going to fundamentally change some of the most important conversations in your life - the ones you have with yourself.” (Adam Grant, best-selling author of Give and Take)

One of the best new books of January 2021 - The Washington Post, BBC, CNN Underscored, Shape, Behavioral Scientist, PopSugar 
Kirkus Reviews and Publishers Weekly starred reviews
Next Big Idea Club finalist
Tell a stranger that you talk to yourself, and you’re likely to get written off as eccentric. But the truth is that we all have a voice in our head. When we talk to ourselves, we often hope to tap into our inner coach but find our inner critic instead. When we’re facing a tough task, our inner coach can buoy us up: Focus - you can do this. But, just as often, our inner critic sinks us entirely: I’m going to fail. They’ll all laugh at me. What’s the use?

In Chatter, acclaimed psychologist Ethan Kross explores the silent conversations we have with ourselves. Interweaving groundbreaking behavioral and brain research from his own lab with real-world case studies - from a pitcher who forgets how to pitch to a Harvard undergrad negotiating her double life as a spy - Kross explains how these conversations shape our lives, work, and relationships. He warns that giving in to negative and disorienting self-talk - what he calls “chatter” - can tank our health, sink our moods, strain our social connections, and cause us to fold under pressure.

But the good news is that we’re already equipped with the tools we need to make our inner voice work in our favor. These tools are often hidden in plain sight - in the words we use to think about ourselves, the technologies we embrace, the diaries we keep in our drawers, the conversations we have with our loved ones, and the cultures we create in our schools and workplaces.

Brilliantly argued, expertly researched, and filled with compelling stories, Chatter gives us the power to change the most important conversation we have each day: the one we have with ourselves.","Easy read for powerful change
I religiously follow BJ Fogg do when he recommended this book I was in. I found it to be remarkable and especially helpful in coaching people with addiction who struggle with excessive chatter. Thanks","Great book
I really enjoyed this book. Not only were there great ideas and suggestions but it was clear, descriptive and well written. He summarizes his “toolbox” of ideas at end which was very helpful.

“Chatter” is a brief yet in-depth look at how the ways by which we talk to ourselves affect our mental and emotional states. Its core message is this: mental chatter, which is fueled by a variety of different internal and external factors, is a massive source of physical and emotional pain in our society. When that chatter gets out of hand, we experience stress, anxiety, doubt, and even depression. Thus, Kross’s goal here is to break down the ways by which we cause our chatter to amplify and provide a plethora of tools we can leverage to quiet that destructive voice in our heads. One of my favorite of those tools is the idea of stepping back from the situation at hand and seeing it from a more distant perspective. As Kross says, we can do this in a multitude of ways. For example, we ask ourselves if the event in front of us will even matter in x number of years. Or, we can talk to ourselves in the second person, calling ourselves by name and, thus, providing an “outsider’s” perspective on the situation at hand. There are many other great stress-reducing strategies that Kross brings to light here as well. All of those strategies are well-researched and strongly reinforced by references to scientific studies — some of which Kross conducted on his own (or with the help of his team). One of the best parts about this book is that all of the above information is covered in a relatively quick fashion. Clocking in around six hours in audiobook format, this one provides lots of useful info without dragging things on for longer than needed. For all of those reasons, I recommend checking this one out. -Brian Sachetta Author of “Get Out of Your Head”"

What Parents Can Do Today for Children Ages 2-5 to Plant the Seeds of Lifelong Success","Dr. Tovah Klein, called ""the toddler whisperer"" on Good Morning America, has penned ""a parenting milestone"" (Dr. Harvey Rotbart, No Regrets Parenting) with How Toddlers Thrive, which shows parents of children ages two to five how to harness the singular power of the toddler mind during what might be the most crucial time of a child's brain development, to plant the seeds of lifelong success.

Why do some children thrive and others struggle? The answers may surprise you. New research indicates that the seeds for adult success are actually planted in the toddler years. Dr. Tovah Klein's research and firsthand work with thousands of toddlers explains why the toddler brain is best suited to laying the foundation for success. Dr. Klein reveals the new science behind drivers such as resilience, self-reliance, self-regulation, and empathy that are more critical to success than simple intelligence. She explains what you can do today to instill these key qualities in your toddler during this crucial time, so they are on track and ready to learn when they enter school at age five.

How Toddlers Thrive explains why the toddler years are different than any other period during childhood. She shows what is happening in children's brains and bodies at this age that makes their behavior so turbulent and why your reaction to their behavior - the way you speak to, speak about, and act toward your toddler - holds the key to a successful tomorrow and a happier today. This provocative book will inspire you to be a better parent and give you the tools to help you nurture your child's full potential. A smart and useful guide, this book cracks the preschooler code, revealing what you can do to help your toddler grow into a fulfilled child and adult - while helping you and your toddler live more happily together now and every day.","Redundant
I wanted very much to like this book as I needed a book to provide guidance on the developmental stages of my toddler. Unfortunately, I found this book to be a waste of time. It was redundant and most of what was discussed was common sense. It would have been more helpful to provide more examples and concrete recommendations of how to help your toddler, then spending most of the book telling you why it's important to see it from your child's perspective, which you already know, which is why you are reading the book in the first place.","Great content, hard to listen to
This book is full of thoughtful and useful concepts, though it might be a better one to read rather than listen to. I found the narrators voice and cadence distracting.

Robert Greene is a master guide for millions of listeners, distilling ancient wisdom and philosophy into essential texts for seekers of power, understanding, and mastery. Now he turns to the most important subject of all - understanding people's drives and motivations, even when they are unconscious of them themselves.  

We are social animals. Our very lives depend on our relationships with people. Knowing why people do what they do is the most important tool we can possess, without which our other talents can only take us so far. Drawing from the ideas and examples of Pericles, Queen Elizabeth I, Martin Luther King Jr, and many others, Greene teaches us how to detach ourselves from our own emotions and master self-control, how to develop the empathy that leads to insight, how to look behind people's masks, and how to resist conformity to develop your singular sense of purpose. Whether at work, in relationships, or in shaping the world around you, The Laws of Human Nature offers brilliant tactics for success, self-improvement, and self-defense.","In this detailed and expansive guide, Greene (Mastery) seeks to … transform the reader into a 'calmer and more strategic observer', immune to 'emotional drama'. Those are lofty promises, but even skeptics will become believers after diving into Greene’s well-organized text. Overcoming the 'law of irrationality', for instance, leads to the ability to 'open your mind to what is really happening, as opposed to what you are feeling'. Greene’s thoughtful examination of self and society will, for the committed reader, deliver a refreshing and revitalizing perspective.","nteresting mix of biography and thoughts
Plays fine at 1.2 speed but still very long. Mostly interesting biographies followed by sometimes tangential but often thoughtful analysis, or opinion rather, but a reasonable opinion except for ... well, I'm not into Jungian archetypes or Freudian explanations. I listened to the whole book, tired just near the end when it seemed a little too much, generational differences oversimplified, death a bit much. I liked the chapter on groups and group dynamics, that's one of many I'd recommend. But why such laborious biographies? Bit hard getting through some, but if you know it's half biography going in, your probably ok."

Use the Power of Food to Reboot Your Metabolism, Upgrade Your Brain, and Transform Your Life","Lose weight, boost your metabolism, and start living a happier life with this transformative 30-day plan for healthy eating from the host of the hit podcast The Model Health Show.

Food is complicated. It's a key controller of our state of health or disease. It's a social centerpiece for the most important moments of our lives. It's the building block that creates our brain, enabling us to have thought, feeling, and emotion. It's the very stuff that makes up our bodies and what we see looking back at us in the mirror. Food isn't just food. It's the thing that makes us who we are. So why does figuring out what to eat feel so overwhelming?

In Eat Smarter, nutritionist, best-selling author, and number-one-ranked podcast host Shawn Stevenson breaks down the science of food with a 30-day program to help you lose weight, reboot your metabolism and hormones, and improve your brain function. Most importantly, he explains how changing what you eat can transform your life by affecting your ability to make money, sleep better, maintain relationships, and be happier. Eat Smarter will empower you and make you feel inspired about your food choices, not just because of the impact they have on your weight, but because the right foods can help make you the best version of yourself. ","Solid. Impactful. Life Changing...if you let it!
You will not find a book smarter than this one to lead you to a healthier lifestyle. Shawn keeps it real, takes off the kid gloves and delivers the research that holds the truth. Eat Smarter is NOT delivering a quick fix...they don’t work y’all...you have to actually DO the work! And the work is eating better quality food. You do NOT have to have any background in nutrition to understand the content happening between the front and back cover...Shawn makes it very palatable and easily digestible. He even gives you a 30 day CUSTOMIZABLE plan to get you started. If your overall goal is better health, this is the guide for you because it will sustain you for a lifetime!!!","Gives us the knowledge to make our own decisions…
This book is not about perfection, it’s about giving us the knowledge to help improve our health wherever we are at in our life today. I’ve been listening to Shawn for years through his The Model Health Show Podcast where he interviews experts that are known from all over. He has helped me in so many more ways than he’ll ever know. He’s information has provided me the foundation I needed to heal my own body after dealing with health issues for years. Through his teachings he’s got me fascinated with the health of our bodies using nutrition, sleep, exercise, and more. Over the last five years, I have read and listened to more than 4,000 hours of books and podcasts that cover nutrition and health. I love listening to him and I'm so glad he's reading his own book! It’s obvious he’s spent years of researching and consolidating peer-reviewed evidence-based studies, so we don’t have to. So thankful for all he has done for me and others through his teaching. There have been so many books I’ve wanted and tried to share with family and friends, but I knew it would be too overwhelming for them. In Eat Smarter, Shawn does a wonderful job, as always, at breaking everything down in a way that it’s easy for others to digest the information and really understand what is going on within you body. He covers how your hormones work, or are suppose to work, along with how different foods affect our bodies. Within, Eat Smarter he breaks down the myths we have been taught throughout our life while providing us highlights from fascinating studies. He also throws in some great humor to keep it fun and entertaining. For anyone looking to improve loose weight, improve gut health, or wants to just learn more of how the body communicates this is the book for you! He does a great job at staying high level to keep the amount of information digestible. He also provides a game plan for long-term lasting success in staying healthy along with delicious and tasty recipes that give you great nutrition, too. He gives us the information we need to make educated food decisions and not subscribe to a specific diet as we have been taught in the past. Makes me curious and think of even more questions I would love for him to cover in Eat Smarter Too (fingers-crossed)."

Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World","The number one New York Times best seller that has all America talking: as seen/heard on CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS, Morning Joe, CBS This Morning, The Bill Simmons Podcast, Rich Roll, and more.

“If you’re a generalist who has ever felt overshadowed by your specialist colleagues, this book is for you.” (Bill Gates)

“The most important business - and parenting - book of the year.” (Forbes)

“Urgent and important...an essential read for bosses, parents, coaches, and anyone who cares about improving performance.” (Daniel H. Pink)

Shortlisted for the Financial Times/McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award

“So much crucial and revelatory information about performance, success, and education.” (Susan Cain, best-selling author of Quiet)

Plenty of experts argue that anyone who wants to develop a skill, play an instrument, or lead their field should start early, focus intensely, and rack up as many hours of deliberate practice as possible. If you dabble or delay, you’ll never catch up to the people who got a head start. But a closer look at research on the world’s top performers, from professional athletes to Nobel laureates, shows that early specialization is the exception, not the rule. 

David Epstein examined the world’s most successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors, forecasters, and scientists. He discovered that in most fields - especially those that are complex and unpredictable - generalists, not specialists, are primed to excel. Generalists often find their path late, and they juggle many interests rather than focusing on one. They’re also more creative, more agile, and able to make connections their more specialized peers can’t see.

Provocative, rigorous, and engrossing, Range makes a compelling case for actively cultivating inefficiency. Failing a test is the best way to learn. Frequent quitters end up with the most fulfilling careers. The most impactful inventors cross domains rather than deepening their knowledge in a single area. As experts silo themselves further while computers master more of the skills once reserved for highly focused humans, people who think broadly and embrace diverse experiences and perspectives will increasingly thrive.","If you're highly curious, read this

The 7 Skills of Positive Parenting to Empower Kids with ADHD. Learn Here the Emotional Control Strategies to Help Your Children Self-Regulate and Thrive","Do you want to finally learn how to behave with children with ADHD?

If you're dealing with ADHD children, your biggest concerns and frustrations deal with not knowing where to seek help and and how to support them during the phases of growth.

You may be asking, “Doesn’t this happen to all kids?” Yes, it happens; all kids lose focus and are hyperactive, especially when anxious or excited. However, ADHD children experience these behavioral disorders over a prolonged period of time and in different settings. Thus, ADHD limits a child’s ability to function socially, academically, and even at home.

This audio guide will give you a comprehensive idea of what ADHD is and how you can deal with children who suffer from it. It will provide you with simple tips and techniques on how ADHD, despite being a serious and complicated disorder, can be dealt with efficiently and properly. Awareness will help you get a grip on your frustration. When you know the triggers, you can prepare for them.

This audiobook covers: 

Accepting your child’s ADHD
The ADHD advantages
Improving social skills 
Behavior therapy techniques
Practices to improve listening skills
Effective methods to contrast behavioral challenges
Managing ADHD with the right nutrition
And much, much more!
Some parents may have trouble accepting the fact that their children got diagnosed with ADHD. It can be difficult to internalize, especially if you see your child as bright, active, and naturally curious. In some cases, parents may have a hard time figuring out when they can be firm and when to be patient. In this audiobook, you get to know the facts about ADHD and its very specific symptoms, strategies to better manage a child who has the disorder, and how to improve your behavior toward your child so that you can be adequately prepared parents.","Horrible reading!

How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure","A timely investigation into the new ""safety culture"" on campus and the dangers it poses to free speech, mental health, education, and ultimately democracy

The generation now coming of age has been taught three Great Untruths: their feelings are always right; they should avoid pain and discomfort; and they should look for faults in others and not themselves. These three Great Untruths are part of a larger philosophy that sees young people as fragile creatures who must be protected and supervised by adults. But despite the good intentions of the adults who impart them, the Great Untruths are harming kids by teaching them the opposite of ancient wisdom and the opposite of modern psychological findings on grit, growth, and antifragility.  

The result is rising rates of depression and anxiety, along with endless stories of college campuses torn apart by moralistic divisions and mutual recriminations.   

This is a book about how we got here. First Amendment expert Greg Lukianoff and social psychologist Jonathan Haidt take us on a tour of the social trends stretching back to the 1980s that have produced the confusion and conflict on campus today, including the loss of unsupervised play time and the birth of social media, all during a time of rising political polarization.    

This is a book about how to fix the mess. The culture of “safety” and its intolerance of opposing viewpoints has left many young people anxious and unprepared for adult life, with devastating consequences for them, for their parents, for the companies that will soon hire them, and for a democracy that is already pushed to the brink of violence over its growing political divisions. Lukianoff and Haidt offer a comprehensive set of reforms that will strengthen young people and institutions, allowing us all to reap the benefits of diversity, including viewpoint diversity.    

This is a book for anyone who is confused by what’s happening on college campuses today, or has children, or is concerned about the growing inability of Americans to live and work and cooperate across party lines.

","Only Praise
I listened to this one directly following a conservative perspective book on diversity. I knew right away that the authors were liberals from the way they spoke about Obama (or didn’t speak) vs the way they spoke about Trump. This however was the only way to know because the evidence presented was very fair, far more fair than the previous book I read with many overlapping themes. I am a conservative who really believes in the great lessons espoused in this book. We need far less antagonism and reaction on left and right if we want to remain a functional republic. I really believe this is what’s best for our nation and children.","Great insights tainted by inclusion of false media spin
Dr Haidt’s book provides valuable insights into our perceptions of life driving dysfunctional behaviors and where we have opportunities to understand the dynamics, and right the course. These insights tend to be associated with Democrat/Liberal beliefs and behaviors, but are stated in a factual manner often backed by research facts. Where Dr Haidt falls short is promoting incorrectly President Trump’s statements regarding the Charlottesville episode (known widely as “the good people hoax), and the actions of the driver of the car that killed a woman in his escape from threats. Contrary to other parts of the book, this narrative seems to be a page out of a left-leaning media report. Dr Haidt either was influenced by his own political bias, or did not actually revue these events with the same clinical, objective eye a social psychologist researcher would do with other data in order to provide an accurate evaluation. I’ve heard interviews with Jonathan Haidt and have no doubt he is a good person with good intentions and who’s work can benefit society. I do wonder how he reconciles his findings with what seems to be his own left-leaning politics, when the data for what is causing large scale societal strife is strongly aligned with attitudes and behaviors tied to people who vote Democrat."

Issues of gender and sexuality long confined to secrecy have become part of everyday conversation, and rigid ideas about our societal roles have begun to dissolve.

And yet, perhaps now more than at any time, men of all ages still “tussle with the challenges of women, work, and sexual desire.” In this unabridged audiobook of the classic guide to masculine spirituality, David Deida encourages men and women to lean into the conversation and offer their most valuable assets to the world - their authentic heart and depth of presence.

More relevant than ever, The Way of the Superior Man offers a view of a more conscious and embodied masculinity. “It is time to evolve beyond the macho jerk ideal, all spine and no heart”, writes Deida. “It is also time to evolve beyond the sensitive and caring wimp ideal, all heart and no spine.”

Including a new preface written in celebration of the book’s 20th anniversary, The Way of the Superior Man presents the next generation of with the opportunity to grapple with fear, cultivate trust in the moment, and put forth the best versions of themselves in an ever-changing world.","Too much goodness to verbalize

What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence","A New York Times Notable Book

The number-one New York Times best seller.

A brilliant and brave investigation into the medical and scientific revolution taking place around psychedelic drugs - and the spellbinding story of his own life-changing psychedelic experiences

When Michael Pollan set out to research how LSD and psilocybin (the active ingredient in magic mushrooms) are being used to provide relief to people suffering from difficult-to-treat conditions such as depression, addiction, and anxiety, he did not intend to write what is undoubtedly his most personal book. But upon discovering how these remarkable substances are improving the lives not only of the mentally ill but also of healthy people coming to grips with the challenges of everyday life, he decided to explore the landscape of the mind in the first person as well as the third. Thus began a singular adventure into the experience of various altered states of consciousness, along with a dive deep into both the latest brain science and the thriving underground community of psychedelic therapists. Pollan sifts the historical record to separate the truth about these mysterious drugs from the myths that have surrounded them since the 1960s, when a handful of psychedelic evangelists inadvertently catalyzed a powerful backlash against what was then a promising field of research.

A unique and elegant blend of science, memoir, travel writing, history, and medicine, How to Change Your Mind is a triumph of participatory journalism. By turns dazzling and edifying, it is the gripping account of a journey to an exciting and unexpected new frontier in our understanding of the mind, the self, and our place in the world. The true subject of Pollan's ""mental travelogue"" is not just psychedelic drugs but also the eternal puzzle of human consciousness and how, in a world that offers us both suffering and joy, we can do our best to be fully present and find meaning in our lives.","A delightful trip
I think the only thing that could make this book better would be a complementary drop of acid on the corner of the last page.","Enthralling and Informative
Michael Pollan is at is finest in How to Change Your Mind. The first third of the book covering the modern history of psychedelics I could take or leave, but the latter two thirds had me rapt and thinking, “what a time to be alive.” To call his closing thoughts moving would be a sorry understatement. 9/10 would read again"

Control Alcohol, Find Freedom, Discover Happiness, and Change Your Life","This Naked Mind has ignited a movement across the country, helping thousands of people forever change their relationship with alcohol.

Many people question whether drinking has become too big a part of their lives and worry that it may even be affecting their health. But they resist change because they fear losing the pleasure and stress relief associated with alcohol and assume giving it up will involve deprivation and misery.

This Naked Mind offers a new, positive solution. Here, Annie Grace clearly presents the psychological and neurological components of alcohol use based on the latest science and reveals the cultural, social, and industry factors that support alcohol dependence in all of us. Packed with surprising insight into the reasons we drink, this book will open your eyes to the startling role of alcohol in our culture and how the stigma of alcoholism and recovery keeps people from getting the help they need. With Annie's own extraordinary and candid personal story at its heart, this book is a must-listen for anyone who drinks.

This Naked Mind will give you freedom from alcohol. It removes the psychological dependence so that you will not crave alcohol, allowing you to easily drink less (or stop drinking). With clarity, humor, and a unique blend of science and storytelling, This Naked Mind will open the door to the life you have been waiting for.

","Had a total “AH-HA” moment. 🤔
I can’t begin to tell you how this book has changed my life! My thinking about alcohol has completely changed so much so that I no longer have a desire to “chase the dragon”. Once you truly understand what alcohol is and how, although worse than many other drugs, is marketed to our society you will begins to DESPISE it. Then when you find out what alcohol is made of and how it affects your brain you will wonder how you could ever have a drink again. BUT when you are made aware of the fact that you are not funnier or cuter when drinking and that the glass of wine you reach for to “relax” and be “happy” actually does the exact opposite you will NEVER want another drink again. This book proved undoubtedly that you do NOT need alcohol to have a good time or to be social. Annie is so precise in detailing all of these facts and more in a guilt free, no judgement zone. She also delves into how our brain works and precisely delivers steps to form new paths in our brain that painlessly help to kick the alcohol habit once and for all and for good. I also love the on line groups & support system,the Facebook page and especially the 30 day Challenge. Thanks Annie for helping me to be FREE OF ALCOHOL","Like flipping a switch
Got in bed on a Sunday morning with a hangover, listened from start to finish, decided that day would be my last day of drinking. Haven’t had one now in 45 days, the longest I’ve gone without alcohol in years. But, get this, NO twinges, no temptations, no bargaining, just no desire to drink motor oil in moderation. Listen to the book, that will make sense. Good luck to you.

Inside the Mind of an American Family","The heartrending story of a midcentury American family with 12 children, six of them diagnosed with schizophrenia, that became science's great hope in the quest to understand the disease.

Don and Mimi Galvin seemed to be living the American dream. After World War II, Don's work with the Air Force brought them to Colorado, where their 12 children perfectly spanned the baby boom: the oldest born in 1945, the youngest in 1965. In those years, there was an established script for a family like the Galvins - aspiration, hard work, upward mobility, domestic harmony - and they worked hard to play their parts. But behind the scenes was a different story: psychological breakdown, sudden shocking violence, hidden abuse. By the mid-1970s, six of the 10 Galvin boys, one after another, were diagnosed as schizophrenic. How could all this happen to one family? 

What took place inside the house on Hidden Valley Road was so extraordinary that the Galvins became one of the first families to be studied by the National Institute of Mental Health. Their story offers a shadow history of the science of schizophrenia, from the era of institutionalization, lobotomy, and the schizophrenogenic mother to the search for genetic markers for the disease, always amid profound disagreements about the nature of the illness itself. And unbeknownst to the Galvins, samples of their DNA informed decades of genetic research that continues today, offering paths to treatment, prediction, and even eradication of the disease for future generations. 

With clarity and compassion, best-selling and award-winning author Robert Kolker uncovers one family's unforgettable legacy of suffering, love, and hope.

","A story you've never heard before
I was fascinated by the study of Schizophrenia and how it intersected with one family. I didn't appreciate how misunderstood the disease was (and still is...) and how treatment can be as bad as the disease itself. The family at the heart of the story is full of secrets, trauma, and denial while also demonstrating tremendous amounts of love, loyalty, and acceptance. I listened to the whole thing in 2 days! A warning: Some content is difficult to listen to so be wary if you are triggered by descriptions of violence or serial abuse","I could not stop listening
An outstanding book and really like nothing I’ve ever read. The story of the family was intriguing but also the clinical info was so informative . You won’t be disappointed!

","Life changing book for caretaker types
I highly recommend this book to anyone who feels like they give to others too much, and receive little to nothing in return. To those of us who feel like we can’t say no to others and let other people’s emotions dictate our actions... to those of us who say yes to chores, or even social outings we do not wish to participate in to make another person happy... I never would have thought of myself as codependent. I think of myself as a strong, but giving leader. This book was a game changer for me. I now have the confidence to start setting boundaries, say “no” and even ask others for favors without that overwhelming feeling of guilt I used to have. I highly recommend this book.","Any additional comments?

At the age of 35, I had finally realized that I had an issue with codependency, but I honestly didn't know why. No one in my family was an alcoholic or addicted to drugs or anything. Then I became aware of this book. At first, I'll admit, I was worried that this book wouldn't work for me because it seemed to be very focused on codependency related to alcoholism. However, as the book progressed, it began touching on the other causes of codependency. Thanks to this book, I now realize that my codependent tendencies are a result of being abandoned by my father and then being raised in a militaristic family where my opinions, thoughts, and feelings didn't matter. This was a true breakthrough for me. It has allowed me to finally begin to heal the wounds that have been there for years. So even if your codependent issues aren't due to someone's chemical dependency, this book can be a huge help."

The Quest for True Belonging and the Courage to Stand Alone","A timely and important new audiobook that challenges everything we think we know about cultivating true belonging in our communities, organizations, and culture, from the number one best-selling author of Rising Strong, Daring Greatly, and The Gifts of Imperfection. 

Hello Sunshine book club pick 

“True belonging doesn’t require us to change who we are. It requires us to be who we are.” Social scientist Brené Brown, PhD, LMSW, has sparked a global conversation about the experiences that bring meaning to our lives - experiences of courage, vulnerability, love, belonging, shame, and empathy. In Braving the Wilderness, Brown redefines what it means to truly belong in an age of increased polarization. With her trademark mix of research, storytelling, and honesty, Brown will again change the cultural conversation while mapping a clear path to true belonging. 

Brown argues that we’re experiencing a spiritual crisis of disconnection, and introduces four practices of true belonging that challenge everything we believe about ourselves and each other. She writes, “True belonging requires us to believe in and belong to ourselves so fully that we can find sacredness both in being a part of something and in standing alone when necessary. But in a culture that’s rife with perfectionism and pleasing, and with the erosion of civility, it’s easy to stay quiet, hide in our ideological bunkers, or fit in rather than show up as our true selves and brave the wilderness of uncertainty and criticism. But true belonging is not something we negotiate or accomplish with others; it’s a daily practice that demands integrity and authenticity. It’s a personal commitment that we carry in our hearts.” 

Brown offers us the clarity and courage we need to find our way back to ourselves and to each other. And that path cuts right through the wilderness. Brown writes, “The wilderness is an untamed, unpredictable place of solitude and searching. It is a place as dangerous as it is breathtaking, a place as sought after as it is feared. But it turns out to be the place of true belonging, and it’s the bravest and most sacred place you will ever stand.”

","Actual Step-By-Step To Authenticity!
I tried fitting in all through my public school years. Then I gave up, dyed my hair, donned combat boots, and started sporting a Mohawk. And I became wildly popular as a nonconformist.
Still, I was miserable. I had no idea how to be me, whatever that entailed.
I love Brene Brown, have all her books, and each has inspired me. Still, inspirational and actionable are two different things.
Finally! Braving the Wilderness has steps one can really, honestly, truly take to get to that fabled goal of Authenticity. Her research brought her to the wonderful checklist, an acronym: BRAVING, where B is Boundaries, A is Accountability, I is Integrity, G is Generosity, and the other letters/elements are covered also in great detail. The challenges that arise with each of these elements are covered, everything, the whole nine yards.
Also, and this I thought was brave of her, Brene discusses how exactly we got to be the volatile, fractured nation we are today; plus she highlights steps we can take to make our interactions with each other more humane, more transformative. And it's not by staying in our own camps either. I know: HARD.
Her narration is warm, her examples, some her own on how NOT to do something, are enlightening, her hope is genuine and contagious.
Okay, so no Mohawk here. But I am ready to take those fearsome, courageous, first few steps...!

","Love this!
I absolutely love this book and my love for Brene deepens more and more! Not only is she a great writer and speaker but she delivers the message in a genuine "" I really care about you"" tone. Keep up the good work Brene! We love you!"

The Power of Thinking Without Thinking","The landmark book that has revolutionized the way we understand leadership and decision making - from number-one best-selling author Malcolm Gladwell.

In his landmark best seller The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant, in the blink of an eye, that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work, in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? 

In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of ""blink"": the election of Warren Harding; ""New Coke""; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of ""thin-slicing"", filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables. 

Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made The Tipping Point a classic, Blink changes the way you understand every decision you make. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.

","A great communicator
As usual Mr. Gladwell has impressive insights. This time he looks at the power of 'thin slicing' which is essentially making a snap judgment about something. The key to that blink reaction being accurate though has much to do with the observers expertise in an area (you need to have some) and the context in which they are making the determination (you need to have a neutral, unbiased way to make the judgment or it may be unavoidably affected)","Great read
The first review on here is generally accurate in terms of book contents, the book doesn't necessarily have the contradictions it suggests. But it may not offer the solutions that everyone hopes will help them find the mysteries of the universe, either. The problem is that where science is concerned many think that there are always concrete answers, but that is simply the fartheset thing from the truth.

What this book does do is have a lengthy discussion about the things that influence our choices and informs our decisions. There is no firm answer because everyone makes decisions based on a different set of experiences, even if many of them are common.

While perhaps a bit long in a place or two, the author takes a great deal of time to fully present his thoughts which are often complex. I thought while much of the information here is known, it is presented in a way that helps readers understand his concepts."

Peterson's Maps of Meaning is now available for the first time as an audio download!  

Why have people from different cultures and eras formulated myths and stories with similar structures? What does this similarity tell us about the mind, morality, and structure of the world itself? From the author of 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos comes a provocative hypothesis that explores the connection between what modern neuropsychology tells us about the brain and what rituals, myths, and religious stories have long narrated. A cutting-edge work that brings together neuropsychology, cognitive science, and Freudian and Jungian approaches to mythology and narrative, Maps of Meaning presents a rich theory that makes the wisdom and meaning of myth accessible to the critical modern mind.

","The lectures are many times better
I've watched all of the Maps of Meaning lectures of Dr. Peterson, plus most of his lecture series on Personality; I also listened to his Twelve Rules of Life audiobook. I liked all of them, so I thought this book might inspire me even more. Nothing could be further from the truth, alas. It's too verbose, has no coherent structure (unlike the lectures) and the chapters are ridiculously long. I mean, 11 hours for one chapter; for the audio version at least more chapters would have been helpful. If you want to get what he's thinking and saying, watch the Maps of Meaning lecture series, all of them, and skip this book. His narration is great though. He reads with the same passion he lectures with, and probably writes with too. I find him one of the best narrators for serious works of literature I know, judging from his reading quotes from The Gulag Archipelago, the works of Dostoyevski, Orwell, and several others. He has a real knack for that, I think because he really understands those works and therefore knows which words to emphasize, where to sound appalled or angry, where to raise or lower his volume, etc. If he would narrate those works here on Audible, I'd probably buy all of those books, knowing I would get a great understanding of the works through listening to Peterson as narrator.

","This is NOT an easy book
Jordan Peterson has claimed on twitter (multiple times) that 12 Rules for Life is a good introduction to Maps of Meaning. Bullsh*t. This book is FAR more difficult to follow than 12 Rules. It wasn't written for the general public. It's in a different galaxy. It is, however, a great book, but I can tell I'm going to have to listen to it at least twice to absorb what Peterson is saying. If you love JBP, you'll enjoy this book, but be warned: this milkshake is extremely thick."

I love Mel Robbins and think she is very gifted motivational speaker. I purchased the book to gain some insight on how to overcome fear. However, the format of the book (listening to various therapy sessions) did not leave me feeling uplifted, but rather depressed. Some of the stories involve very complex personality issues, stories of abuse, etc. I have no doubt Mel was enormously helpful for these individuals, but I found this audiobook very difficult to listen to. I ended up scanning through and attempting to listen to each story and ultimately returned it.","You are the CEO of your life
This book brought awareness of my negative beliefs, thoughts and body language. I discovered my fear and it really changed how I view the world now. I have been a chameleon, people pleaser most of my life. I couldn't believe that I did it without thinking. No wonder why I have so much anger, resentment built inside of me. I now know why I get so defensive and judgmental. It was awesome to hear the coach sessions because I am not alone and it feels good knowing other people struggle with the same issues. The techniques Mel talks about in each session is game changing. I apply them one day at a time, brick by brick and in small doses so I don;t get overwhelmed and end up with the reverse effect. I unfollowed so many people on all my social media channels to get that poison out of my life and it really works. The only things I see now are things that make me happy, empower me and help me get to my dream and goals. Changing your mindset and gaining control of your mind is truly the most powerful thing a person can do for themselves. It is truly game changing and empowering. I am so proud of myself for taking these steps and investing in me. Mel, you helped me change my mind and I love you for it.

The authors have enormously valuable information but fail to present it in a concise and direct format. There is so much repetition and careful couching of concepts that I found it difficult to stay focused on the book.","most helpful parenting book I've ever ""read"".
I will recommend this book to anyone that is struggling with their parenting or is having issues with their self confidence with their parenting.
Daniel and Tina comfort you while also providing insight into the mechanics of brain development and invite you to be more curious about why our children behave the way they do. they give you strategies paired with questions/comments to ask and make. I've used them in moments of upset with my 5 year old and have had beautiful moments of connection after she has settled her big feelings. There was one day, where she cried for 50 minutes. First it was because it was time to get on the bus (no Wi-Fi for the iPad) then it was that she wanted to go for dinner, and then she wanted a treat. It was loud and unrelenting. I struggled to get through it and my internal dialogue was less than positive at times (brat, ungrateful, spoiled) but it also included sympathy for her big feelings and an understanding that it was probably about something else. In the end, through her tears, she said, I just want a big big big big... hug. I held her and she said, I don't know why I'm crying. I don't know what's wrong with me. such simple words but they made me realise that there are moments we all have that we are confused and lost. me getting mad at her for that would have made me feel like a terrible mother. I'm still learning to stay calm and allow my kids to have those moments of loud and intense emotions so will definitely listen to this book when I am struggling."

How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference","Why did crime in New York drop in the mid-90s? Why is teenage smoking out of control? Why are television shows like Sesame Street good at teaching kids how to read?

In The Tipping Point, New Yorker writer Malcolm Gladwell looks at why major changes in society happen suddenly and unexpectedly. Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a few fare-beaters and graffiti artists fuel a subway crime wave, or a satisfied customer fill the empty tables of a new restaurant. These are social epidemics, and the moment when they take off, when they reach their critical mass, is the Tipping Point.

Gladwell uncovers the personality types who are natural pollinators of new ideas and trends. He analyzes fashion trends, smoking, children's television, direct mail and the early days of the American Revolution for clues about making ideas infectious.

The Tipping Point is an intellectual adventure story with an infectious enthusiasm for the power and joy of new ideas. Most of all, it is a road map to change, with a profoundly hopeful message: that one imaginative person applying a well-placed lever can move the world.

","Sociology for the masses.
Another hit by Mr. Gladwell. He take something as dry as sociology and presents the theories in vignettes that are so interesting, yet are factual demonstrating the points he is walking the reader through. I wish more teachers were as stimulating as him. One other point, this book is read by the author which I really appriciate. This gives you more the intent and tone of the original author.","Exciting narrative with great vingettes
The author is an incredibly good story teller. He tells us many great stories from the ride of Paul Revere, the resurgent popularity of Hush Puppies, Sesame Street and to the reduction of violence in New York City. He links them all together with the overriding theme of fundamental change (the tipping point) within society. Each of the vignettes are exciting and will keep you on the edge of your seat and support his main narrative. In addition, he provides a survey of the then current state of the art of the relevant science.

The book was originally published in 2002 and his concept of 'connectors' is only enhanced by what has transpired with Facebook and the further development of the internet. The book is still just as relevant today.

After listening, you will quote some of his stories to your friends and will embrace them within yourself as your own version of reality. Any book which makes you see the world in a different way is a good book and this is a good book.

Usually, I don't like it when an author reads his own book. This one is an exception. I wish that all authors who read their own book would first listen to this book and emulate his style since he does such a good job in the reading."

How the Ability to Reset Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead","Social scientist Brené Brown has ignited a global conversation on courage, vulnerability, shame, and worthiness. Her pioneering work uncovered a profound truth: Vulnerability - the willingness to show up and be seen with no guarantee of outcome - is the only path to more love, belonging, creativity, and joy. But living a brave life is not always easy: We are, inevitably, going to stumble and fall.

It is the rise from falling that Brown takes as her subject in Rising Strong. As a grounded theory researcher, Brown has listened as a range of people - from leaders in Fortune 500 companies and the military to artists, couples in long-term relationships, teachers, and parents - shared their stories of being brave, falling, and getting back up. She asked herself, what do these people with strong and loving relationships, leaders nurturing creativity, artists pushing innovation, and clergy walking with people through faith and mystery have in common? The answer was clear: They recognize the power of emotion, and they’re not afraid to lean in to discomfort.

Walking into our stories of hurt can feel dangerous. But the process of regaining our footing in the midst of struggle is where our courage is tested and our values are forged. Our stories of struggle can be big ones, like the loss of a job or the end of a relationship, or smaller ones, like a conflict with a friend or colleague. Regardless of magnitude or circumstance, the rising strong process is the same: We reckon with our emotions and get curious about what we’re feeling; we rumble with our stories until we get to a place of truth; and we live this process, every day, until it becomes a practice and creates nothing short of a revolution in our lives. Rising strong after a fall is how we cultivate wholeheartedness. It’s the process, Brown writes, that teaches us the most about who we are.

One of Greater Good's favorite books of the year.

“[Brené Brown’s] research and work have given us a new vocabulary, a way to talk with each other about the ideas and feelings and fears we’ve all had but haven’t quite known how to articulate.... Brené empowers us each to be a little more courageous.” (The Huffington Post)

","Life Changing!
I immediately listened to the whole thing twice. The first time through to let it sink in uninterrupted and the second to make notes (many) along the way. This is the first of Brene's books I've read and the others are now on my list. I am going out and buying copies for gifts. it should be required reading in schools! Do yourself a favor for life, and soak in this book. It will change the way you do life!

","A Gem, But Not Her Best
Sure, I'll say it--I couldn't wait for this audiobook to come out, especially since it's narrated by Brene Brown herself (skipped ""Daring Greatly"" as I couldn't stomach Karen White's performance. Funny, she's done fine in other things).
I wasn't disappointed; not by a long shot. Who doesn't need to learn how to fail? Everything is covered in this book: Grief, fear, her (neurotic/humorous) search to find that people are doing the best they can with the tools they have, courage, racism, love.
But along with all of it is: Daring, vulnerability, imperfection, shame. All previously done books.
Don't get me wrong. It's information that can be listened to and used time and time again, just expect to hear some of the stories you've heard before if you're a big time fan. And expect to hear it in a bit of a choppy delivery. This is a reading, not a TED talk, so there are only a few casual, intimate moments. Mostly they come when she's relating personal stories, and they're to die for! I do so love the goofball Texan in her!
All in all, I'm very happy to have gotten this (I mean, obviously. I listened to it right away). It'll help me as I submit my novel, and receive rejection after rejection after rejection...
But ""The Power of Vulnerability"" is still my favorite; I think Brene Brown really, really shines in that Speech."

Discover the Foods Scientifically Proven to Prevent and Reverse Disease","From the physician behind the wildly popular website Nutrition Facts, How Not to Die reveals the groundbreaking scientific evidence behind the only diet that can prevent and reverse many of the causes of disease-related death.

The vast majority of premature deaths can be prevented through simple changes in diet and lifestyle. In How Not to Die, Dr. Michael Greger, the internationally renowned nutrition expert, physician, and founder of Nutrition Facts, examines the 15 top causes of premature death in America - heart disease, various cancers, diabetes, Parkinson's, high blood pressure, and more - and explains how nutritional and lifestyle interventions can sometimes trump prescription pills and other pharmaceutical and surgical approaches, freeing us to live healthier lives.

The simple truth is that most doctors are good at treating acute illnesses but bad at preventing chronic disease. The 15 leading causes of death claim the lives of 1.6 million Americans annually. This doesn't have to be the case. By following Dr. Greger's advice, all of it backed up by strong scientific evidence, you will learn which foods to eat and which lifestyle changes to make to live longer.

History of prostate cancer in your family? Put down that glass of milk, and add flaxseed to your diet whenever you can. Have high blood pressure? Hibiscus tea can work better than a leading hypertensive drug - and without the side effects. Fighting off liver disease? Drinking coffee can reduce liver inflammation. Battling breast cancer? Consuming soy is associated with prolonged survival. Worried about heart disease (the number-one killer in the United States)? Switch to a whole-food, plant-based diet, which has been repeatedly shown not just to prevent the disease but often to stop it in its tracks.

In addition to showing what to eat to help treat the top 15 causes of death, How Not to Die includes Dr. Greger's Daily Dozen - a checklist of the 12 foods we should consume every day. Full of practical, actionable advice and surprising, cutting-edge nutritional science, these doctor's orders are just what we need to live longer, healthier lives.","A stunningly important book
What made the experience of listening to How Not to Die the most enjoyable?

I have read a lot of books on the importance of nutrition -- a LOT. The China Study, anything that Furhman or Weil or Hyman or a dozen others have written. All of them excellent. This one, though, is the one that finally convinced me to quit playing Russian Roulette with my health and get serious. I have listened to it twice and ordered the hard copy because there is so much good information - information backed my multiple studies - about exactly what to eat and why.

If I could only have one book in my library, this would be it. You may not resonate with how Greger reads his book, but the information in it is far too valuable to let that deter you from reading it.
","Clear, Compelling & Transformative
If you only listen to one book about reversing &/or preventing chronic disease related to lifestyle choices this should be the book. The information is research based, scientifically accurate and compelling. Dr Greger presents his subject in language that non-medical people can easily understand. He breaks the book into chapters focused on different diseases--for example heart disease, respiratory illness, & brain disease--to name three of fifteen illnesses covered.

Please don't misunderstand me when I use the term easy. What I mean is that the message Dr Greger is discussing is easy follow and grasp. However, following a plant-based diet is difficult going until you get the hang of it. This is hard work--because processed foods, prepared food, fast food and anything not plant-based is off the list. That said, it is worth the effort. It is possible to heal what ails you by changing what you choose to eat.

Dr Greger has an excellent not-for-profit web site with lots of information and video lectures available as well. He is passionate about educating the public and trying to get his message out there. Sometimes this can feel a bit overwhelming--also occasionally I might have preferred a professional narrator. All that aside, if you want to take charge of your own health and wellness this is the book to read. Life changing and really pretty fantastic."

I dare you not to be inspired to be brave, to be free, and to be curious.” (PopSugar)

From the worldwide best-selling author of Eat Pray Love and City of Girls: the path to the vibrant, fulfilling life you’ve dreamed of. Fantastic inspiration for the new year.  

Readers and listeners of all ages and walks of life have drawn inspiration and empowerment from Elizabeth Gilbert's books for years. Now this beloved author digs deep into her own generative process to share her wisdom and unique perspective about creativity. With profound empathy and radiant generosity, she offers potent insights into the mysterious nature of inspiration. She asks us to embrace our curiosity and let go of needless suffering. She shows us how to tackle what we most love, and how to face down what we most fear. She discusses the attitudes, approaches, and habits we need in order to live our most creative lives. Balancing between soulful spirituality and cheerful pragmatism, Gilbert encourages us to uncover the ""strange jewels"" that are hidden within each of us. Whether we are looking to write a book, make art, find new ways to address challenges in our work, embark on a dream long deferred, or simply infuse our everyday lives with more mindfulness and passion, Big Magic cracks open a world of wonder and joy. ","Bright flashes of the blindingly obvious
Elizabeth Gilbert can write, this is undeniable. Many passages in this book are elegantly written and bring forth detailed images in your mind of the stories that she's telling.

unfortunately most of the actual content is painfully simplistic she draw simplistic conclusions such as, ""being creative is hard but you should do it anyway,.""

She often reinforces her point with long lists of explanatory terms which ultimately feel somewhat insulting as if I didn't get the idea from the first example. ( The chapter about tricksters just made me angry the examples went on for such a long time.)

it also felt a lot like she couldn't quite decide whether to write a book about how to write a book, or whether to write a book about creativity. iIt's pretty muddy whether this is actually focusd on writing as a creative outlet or if it's more broadly aimed at creativity in general.

in the end, I feel like I know Elizabeth Gilbert much better than I did before I started, but I don't feel like I have any greater access to my own creativity or to an understanding of the creative process than I did before.","Biggest Inspiration In a Long Time
Embrace your ideas, accept and have a conversation with your fear.
I didn't pre-order this book, was ready to pass on it, but then I re-watched Elizabeth's TED talk on ""Your elusive creative genius,"" acknowledged I'd hit a roadblock in my own life, and knew, yup. This might be just what I need.
And it was mind-blowingly good.
Naturally, it's not a perfect book, but for something that's not even 6 hrs. it sure does pack a whole lot into it. You'll learn that fear goes hand in hand with creativity, but the thing to do is to take it on the journey with you but let it know it absolutely will NOT be driving.
The most enchanting concept Gilbert discussed was that the earth is inhabited by Ideas that are just waiting for humans to claim them for manifestation. Which I really feel is true. Sometimes I feel the whole goosebump prickle/brick over the head/just got an amazing idea thing, and it's off to the races. But Gilbert goes further through the entire book because creativity is a long, long process. And sometimes we let it be disheartening, sometimes we even view it as the worst, most abusive person in the world when, really, creativity values and needs us. We have the opportunity to open our very souls to wonder, and we can invite even more inspiration into our lives, when we feel stumped, by taking baby-steps of action, and by simply declaring that we enjoy our creativity--we have to appreciate what we have. Plus, gotta kick the perfectionist habit which is fear-based; the way to function best is as ""the disciplined half-ass"" (which is a TOTAL relief to me. The half-assed part, I'm working on the discipline...)"

You will see how these parents create a sense of neglect and discover ways to heal from the pain and confusion caused by your childhood. By freeing yourself from your parents' emotional immaturity, you can recover your true nature, control how you react to them, and avoid disappointment. Finally, you'll learn how to create positive new relationships so you can build a better life.

","Astonishing information.
It seem that my whole life I was searching for the information in this book. I came upon this book by strange chance, and I'm so pleased to have found it. Thank you audible for having us in your library this book has shown me so much about myself and my family structure. I absolutely recommend it, not only to those who feel that they might have emotionally immature parents, but also for those people who feel that their own partner might be suffering from emotionally immature parents. Performance only gets 3 stars because the narrator seemed to inconsistently flip-flop between the ""character voice"" to a regular reading voice when it came to the case studies, or examples from clients.

","Fantastic and applicable
As an adult child of someone with two emotionally immature parents (unbeknownst to me until I found this book), I have never felt more understood in my life. This book scientifically and research-based explained my experiences and who my parents are/why I have habits that I do. It has served to help me manage my parent relationships in a way that protects me from emotional and psychological hurt while also helping me to realize areas I need to improve in because of poor habits I have learned/used. I couldn't recommend this book more highly.

A Survival Guide to Life with Children Ages 2-7","A must-have resource for anyone who lives or works with young kids, with an introduction by Adele Faber, coauthor of the international best-seller The Boston Globe dubbed ""The Parenting Bible"".

For over 35 years, parents have turned to How to Talk So Kids Will Listen & Listen So Kids Will Talk for its respectful and effective solutions to the unending challenges of raising children. Now, in response to growing demand, Adele's daughter, Joanna Faber, along with Julie King, tailor How to Talk's powerful communication skills to children ages two to seven.

Faber and King, each a parenting expert in her own right, share their wisdom accumulated over years of conducting How To Talk workshops with parents and a broad variety of professionals. With a lively combination of storytelling, cartoons, and fly-on-the-wall discussions from their workshops, they provide concrete tools and tips that will transform your relationship with the young kids in your life.

What do you do with a little kid who...won't brush her teeth...screams in his car seat...pinches the baby...refuses to eat vegetables...runs rampant in the supermarket? Organized according to common challenges and conflicts, this book is an essential emergency first-aid manual of communication strategies, including a chapter that addresses the special needs of children with sensory processing and autism spectrum disorders.

This user-friendly guide will empower parents and caregivers to forge rewarding, joyful relationships with terrible two-year-olds, truculent three-year-olds, ferocious four-year-olds, foolhardy five-year-olds, self-centered six-year-olds, and the occasional semi-civilized seven-year-old. And, it will help little kids grow into self-reliant big kids who are cooperative and connected to their parents, teachers, siblings, and peers.","The message is great but the narration and writing style cringey
I love the message of this book and the way it is telling you to communicate etc, that is spot on and helpful However the way this book is written is so cringey. Constantly hearing “and the group replied back “ “And then the group” “Insert a bunch of replies that sound so made up and straight out of a 80s sitcom over and over” It just makes it SO hard to listen too. I hate it, I’ve stopped listening about 3 hours in. The narrator voice also compounds this problem, I’m sorry to say. Coming from listening to Laura Markhams audiobook really highlighted how hard this is to listen to or read.
","Interesting, practical, useful.
Thank you for writing this! I recommend to any parent. Was extremely helpful. Already seen improvements and got me thinking about it scientifically again instead if just flabbergasted parent.

Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion","Why can’t our political leaders work together as threats loom and problems mount? Why do people so readily assume the worst about the motives of their fellow citizens?

In The Righteous Mind, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt explores the origins of our divisions and points the way forward to mutual understanding. His starting point is moral intuition - the nearly instantaneous perceptions we all have about other people and the things they do. These intuitions feel like self-evident truths, making us righteously certain that those who see things differently are wrong.

Haidt shows us how these intuitions differ across cultures, including the cultures of the political left and right. He blends his own research findings with those of anthropologists, historians, and other psychologists to draw a map of the moral domain, and he explains why conservatives can navigate that map more skillfully than can liberals. He then examines the origins of morality, overturning the view that evolution made us fundamentally selfish creatures.

But rather than arguing that we are innately altruistic, he makes a more subtle claim - that we are fundamentally groupish. It is our groupishness, he explains, that leads to our greatest joys, our religious divisions, and our political affiliations. In a stunning final chapter on ideology and civility, Haidt shows what each side is right about, and why we need the insights of liberals, conservatives, and libertarians to flourish as a nation.

","Fundamentally changed my thinking
This book only earned its fifth star from me a week after I finished it and I realized it had changed the way I think about other humans.

Reading political arguments on Facebook, I've started thinking about everyone's position in terms of the underlying values Haidt identifies. It is particularly valuable to me to understand the impact that ""sacred"" ideas have on people's thinking. Surface-level logic won't help to budge a person if it contradicts what's sacred to them, so either arguments need to work with that, or strong emotional tools are necessary that can reach and adjust that sacred value itself. It's a simple but profound insight that will influence how I do my job for years to come, so a book that accomplishes that deserves five stars.

The first few chapters alone are worth the price of the book. If you ever want to convince anyone of anything, understanding the power of our emotional instincts and how our logical mind works to rationalize them is necessary.

I will quibble with a few things. It is unclear whether the author believes there truly are six distinct moral frameworks that have separately and physically evolved in the mind, or whether this is just a useful artificial system of categories to help understand a much more complex underlying moral system. The conflation of what's real and what's a useful abstraction leads to some sloppy thinking. He assumes that each moral framework are set up as binaries (good v. bad) without defending why the brain would work that way. So, for example, he suggests our sense of sacredness can only exist if we have a sense of disgust to contrast it. Maybe, maybe not. The fact he offered no evidence suggests the idea is so embedded in his thinking he doesn't realize it's an empirical question.

Heidt is also, at times, slips into relativism, suggesting (I think without meaning to) that understanding why someone believes something is right or wrong is to justify that moral belief. Better understanding why people believe what they do is valuable for moving issues forward. It does not require that we respect or agree with throwing acid in women's faces or treating lower classes with discrimination. While he himself makes this point late in the book, he avoidably crosses the line into relativism more than once early on.

He spends the latter part of the book defending the value of religion as a group adaptation to allow humans to work together more effectively. Some of his evidence here feels flaky, like the powerful common feeling ravers feel while dancing. While ravers like to suggest they are building a stronger sense of common humanity, because that idea makes them feel good, I have first-hand experience to suggest that this is bullshit. His conclusions are compelling and suggest a need for atheists to think about accomplishing what religion does by other means, but as the cliché goes, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. More work needs to be done on the evidence.","This should give you pause.
I just finish this book and I have to admit it give me a great deal of pause As a liberal thinker, i've tried to fully understand the counterpoints to liberalism. And sometimes find myself wondering ""why would anybody want to be a conservative?"" Well, I seem to understand better now. Not that I'm going to abandon liberalism, but rather try to understand conservatism better."

All our lives are constrained by limited space and time, limits that give rise to a particular set of problems. What should we do, or leave undone, in a day or a lifetime? How much messiness should we accept? What balance of new activities and familiar favorites is the most fulfilling? These may seem like uniquely human quandaries, but they are not: computers, too, face the same constraints, so computer scientists have been grappling with their version of such problems for decades. And the solutions they've found have much to teach us.

In a dazzlingly interdisciplinary work, acclaimed author Brian Christian (who holds degrees in computer science, philosophy, and poetry, and works at the intersection of all three) and Tom Griffiths (a UC Berkeley professor of cognitive science and psychology) show how the simple, precise algorithms used by computers can also untangle very human questions.

From finding a spouse to finding a parking spot, from organizing one's inbox to understanding the workings of human memory, Algorithms to Live By transforms the wisdom of computer science into strategies for human living.","Loved this book!
The authors take us on an easy-to-understand grand tour of the science of computer algorithms — stopping, sorting, caching, predicting, game theory, and much more — and then do a marvelous job of explaining The application of these algorithms to the most mundane problems of everyday human experience — parking, dating, remembering, playing poker, etc. A tour de force! I enjoyed it greatly, and recommended it to several friends.","diamonds among the brickwork

That’s understandable. The key to losing weight is in the mindset, and that’s the first thing you have to change!

My name is Joanna. I’m 30 years old, and I weigh 95 kg (209 pounds). Everyone tells me that’s fine, and I need to accept my body as it is - but how true is that, really?

When I look in the mirror, I don’t like what I see. And, maybe, some people out there are happy with their bodies, but I know in my heart I will never be. So, I made the decision to lose weight, and I never looked back. Are you ready to make that decision? 

We’re not here to tell you that you need to lose weight. People can be happy and healthy at any size. But ask yourself this: Do you feel energized? Do you look in the mirror and smile at what you see?

If that’s not the case, it’s time to make a decision and change things. You get to decide your weight. This is the change you can control. 

This book is here to help you change your mindset about food and weight.

Did you know that blueberries can help you cope with the aftereffects of trauma? That salami can cause depression, or that boosting Vitamin D intake can help treat anxiety?

When it comes to diet, most people's concerns involve weight loss, fitness, cardiac health, and longevity. But what we eat affects more than our bodies; it also affects our brains. And recent studies have shown that diet can have a profound impact on mental health conditions ranging from ADHD to depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, OCD, dementia, and beyond.

A triple threat in the food space, Dr. Uma Naidoo is a board-certified psychiatrist, nutrition specialist, and professionally trained chef. In This Is Your Brain on Food, she draws on cutting-edge research to explain the many ways in which food contributes to our mental health and shows how a sound diet can help treat and prevent a wide range of psychological and cognitive health issues.

The author assumes a lot about people and their circumstances. Also the chapter on libido was very one sided focused on men only and their ability to reproduce. Libido should be about fun not men producing enough sperm to continue to over populate the planet. Women's loss of libido is too often tossed aside as unimportant while men's is glorified. it would probably be better if it were more balenced in focusing on pleasing your partner and having a good time and not JUST reproduction. As well as if there were whole seperate chapters for men and women so we could to read them or not without hearing about the glorified sperm count.

","Great for anyone with a brain-based disorder
As a cognitive behavioral neurologist, many patients ask me about what foods they should eat to keep their brain healthy. Although I have been recommending the Mediterranean diet for years to reduce one’s chances of developing Alzheimer’s disease, I didn’t know the data for some other common brain disorders, such as anxiety and depression. Dr. Naidoo does a great job of presenting the data for these and many other disorders. I particularly liked that she shared the details of the studies so that the reader can make up their own mind whether to follow a particular recommendation or not. I also like that she warns the reader against extremism. I will be recommending this book to my patients who want to know more that the basics about how to use food to help their brain-based problems.

Why We Age - and Why We Don't Have To","From an acclaimed Harvard professor and one of Time’s most influential people, this paradigm-shifting audiobook shows how almost everything we think we know about aging is wrong, offers a front-row seat to the amazing global effort to slow, stop, and reverse aging, and calls listeners to consider a future where aging can be treated.

For decades, experts have believed that we are at the mercy of our genes and that natural damage to our genes - the kind that inevitably happens as we get older - makes us become sick and grow old.

But what if everything you think you know about aging is wrong? What if aging is a disease - and that disease is treatable?

In Lifespan, one of the world’s foremost experts on aging and genetics reveals a groundbreaking new theory that will forever change the way we think about why we age and what we can do about it. Aging isn’t immutable; we can have far more control over it than we realize. This eye-opening and provocative work takes us to the front lines of research that is pushing the boundaries on our perceived scientific limitations, revealing incredible breakthroughs - many from Dr. David Sinclair’s own lab - that demonstrate how we can slow down, or even reverse, the genetic clock. The key is activating newly discovered vitality genes - the decedents of an ancient survival circuit that is both the cause of aging and the key to reversing it. Dr. Sinclair shares the emerging technologies and simple lifestyle changes - such as intermittent fasting, cold exposure, and exercising with the right intensity - that have been shown to help lead to longer lives.

Lifespan provides a road map for taking charge of our own health destiny and a bold new vision for the future when humankind is able to live to be 100 years young.","Incredible
Sinclair is the single most interesting scientist I know of, and I just can't get enough of hearing about his and his field's discoveries and the promising future of human biology. Sinclair's discoveries have had a direct impact in me completely regaining my own health after years of Lyme Disease and fatigue, and he is in large part the reason for my newly started journey towards medical school. I can safely say this is currently my all time favorite book. 5/5 no question. Well written and well narrated by the author himself. I blew through it in two days. Thank you, David.","The future is exciting, and I want to be there!
I've been following David Sinclair's research into aging for many years, and this book is a great summary of his work and that of others, where the field of aging research is headed, and what we can expect. Dr. Sinclair is and has always been an optimist. I'm an optimist too, so that's fine by me. While he isn't a medical doctor and can't give medical advice, he discusses supplements he takes and lifestyle choices he makes that he feels are helping him and his own family too, including his 80-year-old father who has returned to work and is enjoying vibrant good health. My own disclaimer, I have been taking an NAD booster for almost five years. I do believe it makes a difference. At 56, I have far more energy than same-aged friends, and I haven't been sick since I started taking it, something Dr. Sinclair mentions too. Because I have inherited a copy of the APOE4 gene for Alzheimer's, I'm always interested in learning about anything I can do (exercise) or take (supplements) that will help prevent that gene from turning on. Toward the final quarter of the book, Dr. Sinclair turns to the ethics of slowing or even preventing aging. What would a world look like in which people might start a new career in their seventies, or enjoy spending time with their great-great-grandchildren, still vital and engaged? How would it impact global overpopulation and use of resources? These are all important questions, and he presents various scenarios in a balanced way. Overall, a fabulous read. I'm going to get the PDF as well so I can look at the charts and images references (recommended by the author as well). I do truly feel that we're on the brink of longevity escape velocity, and I couldn't be more excited!"

What you don't know about yourself can hurt you and your relationships - and maybe even how you make your way in the world. It can also keep you in the shallows with God. Do you want help figuring out who you are and why you're stuck in the same ruts?

The Enneagram is an ancient personality type system with an uncanny accuracy in describing how human beings are wired, both positively and negatively. In The Road Back to You, Ian Morgan Cron and Suzanne Stabile forge a unique approach - a practical, comprehensive way of accessing Enneagram wisdom and exploring its connections with Christian spirituality for a deeper knowledge of God and of ourselves.

Funny and filled with stories, this book allows you to understand more about each of the Enneagram types, keeping you from pausing long after you have heard the chapter about yourself. Beginning with changes you can start making today, the wisdom of the Enneagram can help you get on the road that will take you further along into who you really are - leading you into places of spiritual discovery you would never have found on your own, and paving the way to the wiser, more compassionate person you want to become.","Uncanny, funny, deeply thought provoking.
I got this book on recommendation from a trusted mentor as I was brand new to the concept of the enneagram. I highly recommend this as a fantastic place for people who are curious about it. This book helped me identify my type (2). Discovering my hidden motives and desires has been both fascinating and, in some ways, crushing for me, but definitely worth the pain to better understand myself and the dynamics of my relationships with others.","a good primer
The author does a descent job of holding the attention of the reader with clever comparisons and funny stories. The book summarizes most of what you'd get if you opened the middle of Riso and Hudson wisdom of the Enneagram. and then at the end you get a taste of Richard Rohr to whet the appetite for more. The problem is unless you get a hold of resources where people walk it out, it's interesting but quite a mystery how to apply it best. even so, I found the tone and heart of the book was humble and generous.

A Guide for Occupants","Glorious...You will marvel at the brilliance and vast weirdness of your design."" (The Washington Post)

Bill Bryson, best-selling author of A Short History of Nearly Everything, takes us on a head-to-toe tour of the marvel that is the human body. As addictive as it is comprehensive, this is Bryson at his very best, a must-listen owner's manual for everybody.

Bill Bryson once again proves himself to be an incomparable companion as he guides us through the human body - how it functions, its remarkable ability to heal itself, and (unfortunately) the ways it can fail. Full of extraordinary facts (your body made a million red blood cells since you started reading this) and irresistible Bryson-esque anecdotes, The Body will lead you to a deeper understanding of the miracle that is life in general and you in particular. 

As Bill Bryson writes, ""We pass our existence within this wobble of flesh and yet take it almost entirely for granted."" The Body will cure that indifference with generous doses of wondrous, compulsively listenable facts and information. ","Must Read for the Sheer Fun of It
The Body, A Guide for Occupants, written and narrated by Bill Bryson. If you are a Bill Bryson reader, you know his style and quippy manner of writing. Always a joy, no matter what his subject matter. For you, Bryson fans, just stop reading now, buy the book and add a joyful undertaking to your life. You will not be disappointed; this is a full circuit informational source of data about the body, done by analyzing each system of its makeup, organ by organ, function by function, bacterium by a bacterium and done with typical Bryson élan. For those of you who do not know Bill Bryson; its time to learn. His writing comes with energy, style, and enthusiasm, and a smack of ironic and flip intelligence. Yet, he is always easy to understand. No high flaunting words, just good British syntax. (He is an American ex-pat to Britain.) More important is the fact that when he covers a subject, he gets you all you need to know, and I do mean all the information you may need. As to the science of our bodies, he gives you in a manner that lets the layman know what a chief physician needs to know. Two last points. If you are a person committed to exercising, dieting, or just an ordinary hypochondriac this is a sourcebook for truly understanding your ailment. Bill Bryson is a pretty good reader, as well.","Very well done
I learned a lot. Detailed, but not boring. Bryson did his research, but kept it interesting.

Protect Yourself, Read People, Influence Situations, and Live Fearlessly","Former Secret Service agent and star of Bravo’s Spy Games Evy Poumpouras shares lessons learned from protecting presidents, as well insights and skills from the oldest and most elite security force in the world to help you prepare for stressful situations, instantly read people, influence how you are perceived, and live a more fearless life.

Becoming Bulletproof means transforming yourself into a stronger, more confident, and more powerful person. Evy Poumpouras - former Secret Service agent to three presidents and one of only five women to receive the Medal of Valor - demonstrates how we can overcome our everyday fears, have difficult conversations, know who to trust and who might not have our best interests at heart, influence situations, and prepare for the unexpected. When you have become bulletproof, you are your best, most courageous, and most powerful version of you. Poumpouras shows us that ultimately true strength is found in the mind, not the body. 

Courage involves facing our fears, but it is also about resilience, grit, and having a built-in BS detector and knowing how to use it. In Becoming Bulletproof, Poumpouras demonstrates how to heighten our natural instincts to employ all these qualities and move from fear to fearlessness.

","Not what I had Anticipated, Much Much Better
As an ex-cop/S.W.A.T Team member I expected more bravado, false or otherwise, but this was real. The stuff those that serve our nation and our communities really feel when they are not trying to appear like they are taking it all in stride. I was riveted and deeply moved. This is how it really feels to serve. Thank you for writing this book, I will read it again soon, and probably again after that. Rarely do I feel this way but this author is someone whom I would like to meet one day and thank her for so many things. And yes, I’m sitting with good posture as I write this. Thank you Ma’am. And thank you for your service.

","Finding the Best Versions of Ourselves
WOW, What an amazing life story! I truly appreciate how transparent Poumpouras is when giving her personal narrative of an experience through past and present life events. First off, I love the title and agree Becoming Bulletproof is definitely the perfect fit. As a woman in her mid 20’s I found the key points she covered to be extremely helpful for my own personal journey to find my voice. Evy’s ability to encourage self-reflection and self-awareness, as well as sensibility to empathize with others, highlights a path for readers to grow upon levels of emotional intelligence no matter where they may currently stand in their personal story. I fell in love with her unique references to historical events in American and Presidential history. We all were managing to live a new normal in life when past monumental events like 9/11 occurred just as we are managing with COVID-19 today. However, Poumpouras’ story helps paint a picture for everyone to view in and out of the civilian mindset. I for sure felt like I was receiving 101 coaching lessons right beside her as a Secret Service agent. The greatest part was being able to hear Evy’s actual voice reading to me! I still can’t get over how valuable it is to have audible books especially when the author is the narrator. I am confident that how and what Poumpouras wanted to share left little room for the common misinterpretations a reader can have through plain text. I recommend this book to EVERYONE. Story’s like this inspire me to pay more attention to my own life lessons and themes. Listening to Evy’s story taught me that finding my voice is not always what I thought I should know, who I thought I should learn from and/or when. Just like facing my fear, my voice usually appears right in front of me if I remember to stop, think in the present and listen instead of always wanting to be heard. Thank you for your service and for continuing to share your story Evy Poumpouras!!! -AJ

From Good to Great to Unstoppable","For more than two decades, legendary trainer Tim Grover has taken the greats - Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade, and hundreds of relentless competitors in sports, business, and every walk of life - and made them greater. Now, for the first time ever, he reveals what it takes to achieve total mental and physical dominance, showing you how to be relentless and achieve whatever you desire.

Direct, blunt, and brutally honest, Grover breaks down what it takes to be unstoppable: you keep going when everyone else is giving up, you thrive under pressure, you never let your emotions make you weak. In “The Relentless 13”, he details the essential traits shared by the most intense competitors and achievers in sports, business, and all walks of life. Relentless shows you how to trust your instincts and get in the Zone; how to control and adapt to any situation; how to find your opponent’s weakness and attack. 

Grover gives you the same advice he gives his world-class clients - “don’t think” - and shows you that anything is possible. Packed with previously untold stories and unparalleled insight into the psyches of the most successful and accomplished athletes of our time, Relentless shows you how even the best get better...and how you can too.

The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking","At least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking, reading to partying; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over brainstorming in teams. Although they are often labeled ""quiet,"" it is to introverts that we owe many of the great contributions to society--from van Gogh’s sunflowers to the invention of the personal computer.

Passionately argued, impressively researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, Quiet shows how dramatically we undervalue introverts, and how much we lose in doing so. Taking the reader on a journey from Dale Carnegie’s birthplace to Harvard Business School, from a Tony Robbins seminar to an evangelical megachurch, Susan Cain charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal in the 20th century and explores its far-reaching effects. She talks to Asian-American students who feel alienated from the brash, backslapping atmosphere of American schools. She questions the dominant values of American business culture, where forced collaboration can stand in the way of innovation, and where the leadership potential of introverts is often overlooked. And she draws on cutting-edge research in psychology and neuroscience to reveal the surprising differences between extroverts and introverts.

Perhaps most inspiring, she introduces us to successful introverts--from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Finally, she offers invaluable advice on everything from how to better negotiate differences in introvert-extrovert relationships to how to empower an introverted child to when it makes sense to be a ""pretend extrovert.""

This extraordinary book has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how introverts see themselves.

","Clamorous Praise for ""Quiet""
Quiet will definitely be included in my list for the top nonfiction books of 2012. This is strong praise indeed, given that we are barely in May. The book is that good that I find it inconceivable that 10 other better nonfiction books will be published this year.

The strength of Quiet surprised me, as I went into reading the book a strong skeptic about the whole concept of personality types. I'm a sociologist, and I believe my bones that structure and situations determine behaviors as much as personality. I've also been unimpressed by either the reliability or validity of tests that purport to predict or explain behavior, such as the MBTI. Nor can I confidently report where I fall on the introvert / extrovert scale, and would have a hard time making this judgment about either my spouse or my children.

If you, like me, are skeptical of personality types then you are ideally suited to approach Quiet. Every page of Quiet contained for me some revelation that caused me to re-think and re-evaluate how I approach my relationships and my work, and how I interpret the actions of colleagues and family.

Cain's thesis is individuals vary on how we respond and react to stimuli. For some of us, external stimulus is energy giving and restorative. Other people may enjoy external stimulus, but interactions with other people subtract from the pool of psychic energy and can be depleting. Those people that we call ""introverts"" are those that expend energy in interactions, ""extroverts"" gain energy.

What Cain points out is that our schools and our workplaces have been moving to a state where only the skills and behaviors of extroverts are valued. We want our kids to be assertive and confident. We get worried if our children are reserved, dreamy and quiet. At work we all operate in teams. We look to our colleagues to speak up and to proactively contribute to our discussions and team projects. The vision of the open office, designed to ease collaboration and break down barriers to communication, has captured the imagination of many managers. (I know. I work in just such an open office plan).

Cain believes, and cites lots of evidence to support her ideas, that our efforts to construct our schools and workplaces around only extroverts are counterproductive to our organizations and damaging to individuals. Families, schools and workplaces can be better off with a mix of personality types and styles. We need to design classrooms and workplaces that honor the needs of our colleagues for quiet focus and intensive solo pursuits.

Quiet is one of those books that is so beautifully written and so persuasively argued that one wants to convince everyone else to read along and discuss its conclusions. Sometimes I fantasize about having the sort of wealth that would allow me to hand out books to everyone I come across. Quiet tops my list of books to share so far in 2012.","One of the better of this genre...
I am not going to rave about this book, as others have, but I must say it is a thorough and thoughtful look into a personality type that has not entirely gotten a fair shake in American society. As I said, Cain does a better than usual job here in the pop psychology genre, though even as she seeks to escape two typical traps, she often enough falls in: 1) the overgeneralization of personality type a la Myers-Briggs and 2) the ""feel-good-by association-you're-okay,-Vincent-Van-Gogh-was-just-like-you!"" syndrome. The best parts of the book are where Cain is helping the reader to best utilize various aspects of personality, and fortunately, this make for the majority of the book."

The Missing Key to Finally Tapping into the Universe and Manifesting Your Desires","Why the law of Attraction hasn’t given you the life of your dreams yet...and what to finally do about it once and for all to easily manifest your desires faster than you ever thought possible.

There’s a reason you keep buying all the books. There’s a reason you keep trying all the programs. And after all you’ve learned and all you’ve done, there’s a reason you still haven’t put the pieces together and used the Law of Attraction to manifest the life you’ve always wanted.

And it’s not because it doesn’t work. Let’s be clear. The Law of Attraction works. It’s been working this whole time, with absolute precision, right underneath your nose. 

So why hasn’t it been working for you? What are you missing?

The answers to these questions will not only explain everything in a way you never would have expected, but they’re going to demonstrate with crystal clarity everything you’ve been missing until now.

You’re about to learn firsthand why every other Law of Attraction book never actually worked for you (it’s not what you think - they actually gave you 100 percent accurate info). You’re going to understand how to make the Law of Attraction “do” what you always wanted (it’s easier than you realize - it only takes one small adjustment). And you’re going to stop wasting years of your life wishing for a better way...and finally attract and manifest the money, relationships, health, and success you’ve always dreamed of.

Everything you want has been waiting for you. And it wants you just as much. The time to claim it all has finally arrived. 

This is the last Law of Attraction book you’ll ever need to read / listen.","He's not kidding!
Hat's off, folks!!! I don't know where he received all of his insights, but I happen to own ALL of the other Law of Attraction books, beginning with Napoleon Hill, whom I have become so familiar with that I seriously consider him a friend. I have witnessed many of the seemingly impossible things this author is a witness to, and already know that everything he says here is true -- and it really is as simple as he makes it appear to be. But, this man is clearly a genius full of understanding of the way this works, and his title is no exaggeration. He actually goes into it in SO MUCH detail that, in case you might have missed it, you won't. This guy is a wonderful teacher AND, to be redundant, he really does know how it works. Moreover, he is able to articulate it so that -- as he says -- this really will be the last book on the law of attraction you will ever need. Better still, it is likely to be the first book on the topic that will actually free you to experience the many miraculous things, like I said, that I know these laws will make happen for you. What a miracle that this book came out when it did -- take advantage, it will change your life.

","Wow
The narrator was speaking too quickly so I decreased the speed to x0.85 which worked perfectly for me. Anyway,i am doing meditation and visualizing for the past 20 days consistently so this book only amplified my enthusiasm. I've practically done or read more than 100 self help books in this category and this one takes second spot to Maxwell Maltz Psycho Cybernetics. What this one does best is explain and fine tune any irregularities and questions you may have had. The author ensures you stay committed because one thing you have to understand is that this is a life long process. I once did everything for months straight (before this book) and my life started changing gradually in ways I couldn't imagine. Then I stopped and I fell into my old undesirable habits and life. Sticking to the process was difficult but upon understanding why, I realized that it was all self sabotage. I'm going to read it again because I know better now. Whoever is reading this review, trust in yourself, you will make it to the other side. You've got this far already, you deserve all good things coming to you. It will all make sense after this book.

The Incredible True Story of One Addict's Double Life","An up-close portrait of the mind of an addict and a life unraveled by narcotics - a memoir of captivating urgency and surprising humor that puts a human face on the opioid crisis.

“Raw, brutal, and shocking. Move over, Orange Is the New Black.” (Amy Dresner, author of My Fair Junkie)

When word got out that Tiffany Jenkins was withdrawing from opiates on the floor of a jail cell, people in her town were shocked. Not because of the 20 felonies she’d committed, or the nature of her crimes, or even that she’d been captain of the high school cheerleading squad just a few years earlier, but because her boyfriend was a Deputy Sherriff, and his friends - their friends - were the ones who’d arrested her.

A raw and twisty, pause resisting memoir that sounds like fiction, High Achiever spans Tiffany’s life as an active opioid addict, her 120 days in a Florida jail where every officer despised what she’d done to their brother in blue, and her eventual recovery. With heart-racing urgency and unflinching honesty, Jenkins takes you inside the grips of addiction and the desperate decisions it breeds. She is a born storyteller who lived an incredible story, from blackmail by an ex-boyfriend to a soul-shattering deal with a drug dealer, and her telling brims with suspense and unexpected wit. But the true surprise is her path to recovery. Tiffany breaks through the stigma and silence to offer hope and in","Absolute Best Must Read Book 
This book is a must read for everyone because drugs affect every person's life one way or another and regardless of whether you're someone who is judgemental toward addicts, the parent/spouse/friend of an addict, or if you're going through the daily struggle battling addiction yourself...THIS BOOK IS FOR ALL OF US! It is an amazing page turner and you will laugh, cry and walk away with a better understanding that we are all just human beings that make mistakes but that can overcome them! Thank you for being such a brave inspiration Tiffany Jenkins!","Highly inspirational !
The audio version of this book is incredible! Having the author narrate makes the experience more meaningful. Tiffany has a unique down to earth personality and listening to her tell her story in her own voice was quite moving. While based largely on her substance abuse and the path of destruction it took her on this book is for everyone not just those in recovery. She addresses the life events that prompted her into stepping into the world of alcohol and substance abuse, which include depression and anxiety. The author inspires the reader to get out of their comfort zones and embrace their awkwardness!! I highly recommend this book!"

Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants","Malcolm Gladwell, the number-one best-selling author of The Tipping Point, Blink, Outliers, and What the Dog Saw, offers his most provocative - and dazzling - book yet. 

Three thousand years ago, on a battlefield in ancient Palestine, a shepherd boy felled a mighty warrior with nothing more than a stone and a sling, and ever since then the names of David and Goliath have stood for battles between underdogs and giants. David's victory was improbable and miraculous. He shouldn't have won. 

Or should he have? 

In David and Goliath, Malcolm Gladwell challenges how we think about obstacles and disadvantages, offering a new interpretation of what it means to be discriminated against, or cope with a disability, or lose a parent, or attend a mediocre school, or suffer from any number of other apparent setbacks. 

Gladwell begins with the real story of what happened between the giant and the shepherd boy those many years ago. From there, David and Goliath examines Northern Ireland's Troubles, the minds of cancer researchers and civil rights leaders, murder and the high costs of revenge, and the dynamics of successful and unsuccessful classrooms - all to demonstrate how much of what is beautiful and important in the world arises from what looks like suffering and adversity. 

In the tradition of Gladwell's previous best sellers, David and Goliath draws upon history, psychology, and powerful storytelling to reshape the way we think about the world around us.","The Art of (Unconventional) War
Every few years, Malcolm Gladwell publishes a fascinating, engaging book on an overarching sociological concept. He started in 2000 with ""The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,"" defining that point as ""the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point."" Gladwell isn't creating trends, as the subjects of his 2008 book ""Outliers: The Story of Success"" do. Gladwell, after extensive research, gives the concepts names and stories everyone can understand.

""David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants"" (2013) is a collection of stories about people who do things differently, either because they are different or because they have no choice but to ignore 'conventional wisdom' to fight and win. Gladwell provides many examples of underdogs using unconventional warfare: Irish Catholics; a girl's under 12 basketball coached by a dad who'd never played the game; The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King and the American Civil Rights Movement . . .

By illustration, Gladwell tells the story of Emil Freireich, an oncologist and an incredible social misfit in the pediatric oncology ward he worked in. Dr. Freireich's inability to let emotions into his work - and his ability to think beyond common practices - made him instrumental in finding cures for childhood leukemia. Hundreds of thousands of people owe their lives to a man with the bedside manner of a gruff truck driver who has had one too many coffees and still has five hundred miles to go before the sun rises again.

Gladwell also points out the loss that can happen when someone tries to fit in the wrong place and wrong time. He illustrates that concept using a woman who went to an Ivy League university and lost her passion for science among all the 'big fish' in the competitive shark classes. If she'd gone to a state university, which actually had more qualified, published professors, she would be living her dream now. I have two teenagers, and that resonated with me. My oldest, inculcated by the mantra of 'you must get into A Good College', wonders if I know what I'm talking about when I tell him I want him to find a school that's good for him. Now I've got backup.

Gladwell's books are occasionally fiercely criticized by the scientific community, because they are too general; or because someone believes he has misinterpreted studies and data. Those are valid points, but Gladwell isn't writing a peer reviewed article for publication in ""Evolutionary Behavioral Science"". He's writing for everyone, not just PhD's and MD's, and he's writing to start a conversation, not answer all questions.

I've heard Gladwell in interviews, but this is the first Audible Gladwell book I've listened to. (I have the rest of in hardback, and my favorite is 2005's ""Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking."") Gladwell is a great narrator.

The Audible comes with a PDF file with a photo Gladwell discusses extensively in the book; charts and graphs; and footnotes.","Listen with a Critical Ear
Would you try another book from Malcolm Gladwell and/or Malcolm Gladwell?

Malcolm Gladwell always finds interesting anecdotes and back stories to entertain the reader and provoke thought. I don't always agree with his conclusions, but the least of his writings are still pretty good.

Dale Carnegie’s principles have endured for nearly a century. Since its original publication in 1936, his timeless classic How to Win Friends and Influence People has gone on to sell 15 million copies. Now, introducing new listeners to Carnegie’s words of wisdom, comes How to Win Friends and Influence People in the Digital Age, a new guide for a new era.

Dale Carnegie could never have predicted the trajectory that new media would take, and the ways that the simple television screen would be adapted into computers and handheld communication devices. He didn’t know the term “social media” and Facebook was something not even dreamed of in Buck Rogers cartoons. And yet his lessons remain relevant for everyone who communicates online today. In fact, with problems such as cyber bullying and email etiquette, we need Carnegie’s help more than ever. Dale Carnegie and Associates, Inc. has re-imagined Carnegie’s lasting lessons for this difficult digital age, reframing Carnegie’s insights about communication, self-expression, and leadership. This book is a must-have guide for anyone who wants to find success on Facebook, Linked-In, Twitter, and any social media format today and in the future.

","As titled, it brings the orig. to the digital age.
Having read the original how to win friends, I noticed several of the exact same stories and lessons from the original text. Still they are certainly adequate stories that are appropriate for the lessons being taught. Well written and informative. But the main theme i got is if you wouldn't say it to your mom, don't post it on the net or in any social media. The original text seemed to have more ""meat and potatoes"" contained within the pages. This one seems to focus on what to post and not to post in social media. If you only read one of the two books, digital age or the original title, Id suggest reading the original. When the original text focuses on appropriate ""snail mail"" etiquette, the new version bears the same message substituting various ""social media"" for ""letter"" If you can make that mental substitution, just read the original text and you can get 90-95% of the New version's material from the original and maybe 20% more material that was cut for the digital edition.
","Stick with the Original
Carnegie's original How to Win Friends and Influence people is one of the best books ever written. This book is just ok and really does not provide any significant insight that the original doesn't provide.

Racialized Trauma and the Pathway to Mending Our Hearts and Bodies","My Grandmother's Hands will change the direction of the movement for racial justice."" (Robin DiAngelo, New York Times best-selling author of White Fragility)

In this groundbreaking book, therapist Resmaa Menakem examines the damage caused by racism in America from the perspective of trauma and body-centered psychology.

The body is where our instincts reside and where we fight, flee, or freeze, and it endures the trauma inflicted by the ills that plague society. Menakem argues this destruction will continue until Americans learn to heal the generational anguish of white supremacy, which is deeply embedded in all our bodies. Our collective agony doesn't just affect African Americans. White Americans suffer their own secondary trauma as well. So do blue Americans - our police.

My Grandmother's Hands is a call to action for all of us to recognize that racism is not only about the head but about the body, and introduces an alternative view of what we can do to grow beyond our entrenched racialized divide.

Paves the way for a new body-centered understanding of white supremacy - how it is literally in our blood and our nervous system.

Offers a step-by-step healing process based on the latest neuroscience and somatic healing methods, in addition to incisive social commentary.

The Secrets of Highly Successful Groups","The author of The Talent Code unlocks the secrets of highly successful groups and provides tomorrow’s leaders with the tools to build a cohesive, motivated culture.

Named one of the best books of the year by Bloomberg and Library Journal

Where does great culture come from? How do you build and sustain it in your group, or strengthen a culture that needs fixing? In The Culture Code, Daniel Coyle goes inside some of the world’s most successful organizations - including the US Navy’s SEAL Team Six, IDEO, and the San Antonio Spurs - and reveals what makes them tick. He demystifies the culture-building process by identifying three key skills that generate cohesion and cooperation, and explains how diverse groups learn to function with a single mind. Drawing on examples that range from Internet retailer Zappos to the comedy troupe Upright Citizens Brigade to a daring gang of jewel thieves, Coyle offers specific strategies that trigger learning, spark collaboration, build trust, and drive positive change. Coyle unearths helpful stories of failure that illustrate what not to do, troubleshoots common pitfalls, and shares advice about reforming a toxic culture. 

Combining leading-edge science, on-the-ground insights from world-class leaders, and practical ideas for action, The Culture Code offers a roadmap for creating an environment where innovation flourishes, problems get solved, and expectations are exceeded. Culture is not something you are - it’s something you do. The Culture Code puts the power in your hands. No matter the size of your group or your goal, this book can teach you the principles of cultural chemistry that transform individuals into teams that can accomplish amazing things together.

","If you want to understand how successful groups work - the signals they transmit, the language they speak, the cues that foster creativity - you won't find a more essential guide than The Culture Code. This is a marvel of insight and practicality."" (Charles Duhigg, New York Times best-selling author of The Power of Habit and Smarter Faster Better)
""I've been waiting years for someone to write this book - I've built it up in my mind into something extraordinary. But it is even better than I imagined.

Incredible book that will open your eyes to the millions of potential collisions that ignite innovation, belonging, and a culture of safety we all long to lead and be a member of. Pairs well with Simon Sinek’s Leaders Eat Last and Warren Bennis’ Organizing Genius."

How to Achieve a Lifetime of Sustained Peak Performance","The first book by Tampa Bay Buccaneers and former New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady - the six-time Super Bowl champion who is still reaching unimaginable heights of excellence at 42 years old - a gorgeously illustrated and deeply practical “athlete’s bible” that reveals Brady’s revolutionary approach to sustained peak performance for athletes of all kinds and all ages. 

In this new edition of The TB12 Method, Tom Brady further explains and details the revolutionary training, conditioning, and wellness system that has kept him atop the NFL at an age when most players are deep into retirement. Brady - along with the expert Body Coaches at TB12, the performance lifestyle brand he cofounded in 2013 with Alex Guerrero - explain the principles and philosophies of pliability, a paradigm-shifting fitness concept that focuses on a more natural, healthier way of exercising, training, and living. Filled with lessons from Brady’s own training regimen, The TB12 Method provides step-by-step guidance on how develop and maintain one’s own peak performance while dramatically decreasing injury risks. This illustrated, highly visual manual also offers more effective approaches to functional strength and conditioning, proper hydration, supplementation, cognitive fitness, restorative sleep, and nutritious, easy-to-execute recipes to help readers fuel-up and recover. 

Brady steadfastly believes that the TB12 approach has kept him competitive while extending his career, and that it can make any athlete, male or female, in any sport and at any level achieve his or her own peak performance and do what they love, better and for longer. With instructions, drills, photos, in-depth case studies that Brady himself has used, along with personal anecdotes and experiences from his legendary career, The TB12 Method gives you a better way to train and get results with Tom Brady himself as living proof. ","It Works
There have been a number of negative reviews about this book (i.e. ghost written, lack of science, personal commercial for TB12 products). I am the father of pro athletes and was involved in coaching. I bought the book because I am interested in what makes great athletes i.e.Tom Brady tick. The book did not disappoint.

Brady seems to be off the charts in everything he does. The water he uses to hydrate, the food he uses for fuel, the special pajamas he sleeps in, and of coarse, his pliability workouts. While he pushes TB12 products in the book, he does not say you need to follow his workout or use his products or eat exactly what he eats. He does lay out, in simple language and in an easy to follow pdf, basics that you can follow using equipment and foam rollers available at most gyms or at a low cost. The same basics he has used over the years to accomplish what he has achieved as one of the greatest quarterbacks in the NFL.

I decided to put theory to the test and follow the TB12 method for a month, to see what would happen. I was not as strict as Brady in what I did. For example I did not come close to his discipline in what I ate, My pliability routine was foam rollers vs. deep massage, I substituted a run and a personal workout for his bands, did not spend the 4 hours a day in the gym that he spends in the off season and no special pajamas. Result 4 weeks later: eliminated nagging back, shoulder and knee pain I was having, dropped 8 pounds, feel healthier and more alert. My average 5k run training speed (I'm still pretty slow) increased by 20%. I intend to reread several chapters in the book and add some of the things Brady recommended that I didn't implement over the test month.

A lot of Brady's regimen is not new. What he does do in this book is put everything together in an easy to read manual. I gave it a 5 star rating and have to say thanks to Brady for publishing this book, ghost written or not. Books like this, from athletes who have walked the walk, are hard to find, It definitely has the potential to be a life/training changer.","Motivation and belief to feel better
I started this book about 9 months after a back surgery with the hopes of conditioning my body to prevent the practices and habits that caused my body to break down in the first place. I am going to commit to tb12 pliability approach to facilitate an active pain free life. So far it is working albeit I’m a bit sore as I condition my muscles to be more pliable but it is nothing like the discomfort associated with my earlier back problems."

How to Use the Neuroscience of Fear to End Anxiety, Panic, and Worry","Do you ever wonder what is happening inside your brain when you feel anxious, panicked, and worried? In Rewire Your Anxious Brain, psychologist Catherine Pittman and author Elizabeth Karle offer a unique, evidence-based solution to overcoming anxiety, based in cutting-edge neuroscience and research.

In this audiobook you will learn how the amygdala and cortex (both important parts of the brain) are essential players in the neuropsychology of anxiety. The amygdala acts as a primal response, and oftentimes, when this part of the brain processes fear, you may not even understand why you are afraid. By comparison the cortex is the center of worry - that is, obsessing, ruminating, and dwelling on things that may or may not happen.

Pittman and Karle offer simple, specific examples of how to manage fear by tapping in to both of these pathways in the brain. As you listen, you'll gain a greater understanding of how anxiety is created in the brain, and as a result you will feel empowered and motivated to overcome it.

The brain is a powerful tool, and the more you work to change the way you respond to fear, the more resilient you will become. Using the practical self-assessments and proven-effective techniques in this book, you will learn to literally ""rewire"" the brain processes that lie at the root of your fears.

","Accurate info, well explained
but nothing new here and certainly will not END your anxiety, even the book will say things like manage and accept. It is a huge amount of Cognitive Behavioral Monitoring and massive amounts of work to do on your own. Lot's of recommendations for therapy. Why sell a book that claims to rewire your brain and end anxiety when it doesn't? Mediate, watch your thoughts, journal, exercise, eat right sound familiar. Good basic advice you can get for free from your auntie or the internet. Explaining the difference between limbic/amygdala anxiety and cortex anxiety, while interesting doesn't really help much. Just my opinion. I truly hope others have success.","Extremely helpful book
This book is a really good tool on understanding the way your brain functions to help you manage anxiety. I went threw two suicides three weeks apart with people extremely close to me. This book has really helped to understand why you feel helpless sometimes like you can't control your reactions and emotions but gives you the tools on how this works so you can gain control again and manage your life.

Heal Your Body Through Intermittent, Alternate-Day, and Extended Fasting","Thousands of books have been written about the latest and greatest diets that will help people lose weight and improve health. But a key element in any successful nutritional health program is a tried-and-true method that most people haven't thought about - yet it could be revolutionary for taking health to the next level. This ancient secret is fasting.

Fasting is not about starving oneself. When done right, it's an incredibly effective therapeutic approach that produces amazing results regardless of diet plan. In fact, Toronto-based nephrologist Dr. Jason Fung has used a variety of fasting protocols with more than 1,000 patients, with fantastic success. In The Complete Guide to Fasting, he has teamed up with international best-selling author and veteran health podcaster Jimmy Moore to explain what fasting is really about, why it's so important, and how to fast in a way that improves health. Together, they make fasting as a therapeutic approach both practical and easy to understand.

The Complete Guide to Fasting explains:

Why fasting is actually good for health
Who can benefit from fasting (and who won't)
The history of fasting
The various ways to fast: intermittent, alternate-day, and extended fasting
What to expect when starting to fast
How to track progress while fasting
The weight loss effects of fasting
How to ward off potential negative effects from fasting","I never knew what insulin did. OH MY GOSH!!!

They are both very trim and both are maintaining their weights by fasting. So let me begin by saying, I started a diet on July 1st and told my daughter I was hoping to lose just 10 pounds. Not easy for a guy in his 60's. She told me what she and her husband had done and gave me this book on July 4th. I started listening to it that very day and finished it on July 8th. As I type this, that was 3 weeks and 21 pounds ago!!! One June 30th my Blood pressure was 139/87. This morning it was 122/77. There are a lot of books I really like but when it comes to practical life changing knowledge, I think there is only one book that has changed my life more than this one and that is the Bible. I have never been one who fasts. I might miss a meal, but go several hours, that wasn't for me. Especially doing it for a whole day but the knowledge of how fasting benefits the body has changed my whole attitude. Before it was for a spiritual benefit that, to be honest, I never really felt. Now it is a physical benefit as well and I get its purpose. Understanding the role of insulin in the body has been the key for me as I never knew what it did, how it was produced and it never even entered my mind it could be controlled. Dr. Fung and Jimmy Moore, who did a great job of narrating it, explained the process of how the body functions so clearly that I kept having ""ah-ha"" moments over and over. For those suffering with Type-2 Diabetes, I can't imagine what you go through, but the way this book lays out the role of insulin, I think it will give you hope, I think a whole lot of Doctors should be re-thinking things. For me, I do not have diabetes, so this process is right in my wheelhouse. Fasting is not an issue as I have always liked eating two meals a-day or even one big meal but I have always been told it was unhealthy to do that. Now I know different and even my wife who has always wanted me to eat three times a day is rethinking that old thinking. Having been on the Adkins diet and losing 30 pounds about 15 years ago, I now understand why I gained it all back. After listening to this book (twice now), I understand now how to control the insulin in order to keep the weight off and doing that in a way that fits my schedule as I eat the way I always wanted to. By the way, three days ago I ate at the Texas Road House with my family and had salad with extra Thousand Island dressing, filet steak, loaded baked potato, two roles with cinnamon butter and veggies and this morning I weighed less than at anytime in the last 15 years. How is that possible? Because I understand the role of insulin and that is thanks to this book on fasting. While for me it has been easier to fast than I ever imagined, I know it won't be that way for everyone so I don't want to come across like it is super easy. All I can say is for me, this has worked, is working and I understand why. If you are saying, ""oh this is just a fad"" you are wrong. This is not a fad. It is a change in the way I live my life by understanding how the body works and using that knowledge to control my weight, lower blood pressure and so many other benefits which are explained in this book, Obviously, I highly recommend it and I will come back to update my story later as I still have 20 pound to go. Update... It is September 8th, 2019 and I have now lost 43 pounds and am at my target weight of 195. Blood pressure this morning was 115/68. Haven't seen that since I was 20 years old. I am going to hold at this weight for awhile and then try to lose 10 more pounds.","Great book, REALLY Bad Narrator
This book, especially when read after The Obesity Code, is fantastic. It's so good to me that overall the rating is still 5 stars even though the narration was HORRIBLE. Jimmy Moore seems like a good guy and maybe he's got his fans from his podcast. Maybe he sounds more natural in regular conversation. But he was not the right person to read this audiobook. He sounds like he's never spoken to other people in his life and also like he's not sure how to read. I'm truly sorry, I don't like to be critical of other people, but it was just that bad.

Reconciling the Erotic & the Domestic","Esther Perel takes on tough questions, grappling with the obstacles and anxieties that arise when our quest for secure love conflicts with our pursuit of passion. She invites us to explore the paradoxical union of domesticity and sexual desire, and explains what it takes to bring lust home.

In her 20 years of clinical experience, Perel has treated hundreds of couples whose home lives are empty of passion. They describe relationships that are open and loving, yet sexually dull. What is going on?

In this explosively original book, Perel explains that our cultural penchant for equality, togetherness, and absolute candor is antithetical to erotic desire for both men and women. Sexual excitement doesn't always play by the rules of good citizenship. It is politically incorrect. It thrives on power plays, unfair advantages, and the space between self and other. More exciting, playful, even poetic sex is possible, but first we must kick egalitarian ideals and emotional housekeeping out of our bedrooms.

While Mating in Captivity shows why the domestic realm can feel like a cage, Perel's take on bedroom dynamics promises to liberate, enchant, and provoke. Flinging the doors open on erotic life and domesticity, she invites us to put the ""X"" back in sex.","This book will ruin your marriage. GUARANTEED.
The author wants to ruin the entire foundation of marriage in the United States by propagating her ideas. We already have 53% divorce rate. In this book you will learn to see your love for your spouse and your sexual desire at the opposite sides of the spectrum with no way to reconcile them together! And her subtle solution is to seek desires outside or keep one's spouse as an outsider! She will teach you that you can't have it within your marriage. This book is a prescription for disaster. Ruin the marriage, and you ruin the society. I recommend John Gottman instead. He had a number of great books backed up by research.

","Slices of life
This book is a litany of filler story after filler story of couples not having sex, with no solution offered whatsoever. Her reading is really bad, and her accent is distracting from the content.

By now, emotional intelligence (EQ) needs little introduction - it’s no secret that EQ is critical to your success. But knowing what EQ is and knowing how to use it to improve your life are two very different things.

Emotional Intelligence 2.0 delivers a step-by-step program for increasing your EQ via four, core EQ skills that enable you to achieve your fullest potential:

1) Self-Awareness

2) Self-Management

3) Social Awareness

4) Relationship Management

Emotional Intelligence 2.0 is a book with a single purpose - increasing your EQ. Here’s what people are saying about it:

“Emotional Intelligence 2.0 succinctly explains how to deal with emotions creatively and employ our intelligence in a beneficial way.” - The Dalai Lama

“A fast read with compelling anecdotes and good context in which to understand and improve.” - Newsweek

""Gives abundant, practical findings and insights with emphasis on how to develop EQ. Research shows convincingly that EQ is more important than IQ."" - Stephen R. Covey, author, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

""This book can drastically change the way you think about success...read it twice.","Self-assessment is subjective
I give it 3.5 stars. After purchasing the book, you are given a code to take the emotional intelligence appraisal test online. You rate yourself on a list of statements, like whether you can be counted on, handle stress well, get along with others, and handle conflict effectively. Then based on your responses, you are directed to certain strategies in the book, like practice the art of listening and catch the mood of the room. This is ineffective. Most people can't objectively rate their own behaviors and performance. If you know you are weak in certain areas (self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management), you can practice the strategies in those chapters. However, if you are already aware of your weaknesses and want to improve, you're probably not deficient in emotional intelligence. You're better off selecting a book focused in the area you want to strengthen, such as communication, giving feedback, reading body language, building relationships, making conversations, etc.

Also, the book doesn't provide good illustrative examples where you can picture yourself in those situations and whether you're demonstrating emotional intelligence or not. The examples read like generic performance reviews -- ""she sometimes comes across as defensive or aggressive. So for her to be more aware of her tone and language would be helpful."" There's no context for these statements, like what was said that sounded defensive and what would have been a better alternative.

","This is a good READ.
This wonderful book shines a light on the fact that intelligence, that is ""book smarts,"" is just one component of what contributes to a person's overall success in life. Pursuing qualities such as self-esteem or persistence will make you more effective in your work, as well as bring more joy into your life. He gives you sound examples of how to cultivate areas in your own life, so you are not just reading about how it ""should"" be.

That said, the narrator starts off well reading this book. He is engaging and fairly easy to listen to. However, at the points when he needs to share the quotes of a variety of people, he uses a strange and almost comical variety of voices and it does not work well. I became so annoyed with this over-acting, that eventually, I had to skip through it. It is truly awful.

I had read the book, and just wanted to reiterate the information more clearly in my mind as I drove. Reading the book is worth the effort!"

The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us","Forget everything you thought you knew about how to motivate people--at work, at school, at home. It's wrong. As Daniel H. Pink explains in his new and paradigm-shattering book, the secret to high performance and satisfaction in today's world is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world.

Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business does - and how that affects every aspect of our lives. He demonstrates that while the old-fashioned carrot-and-stick approach worked successfully in the 20th century, it's precisely the wrong way to motivate people for today's challenges. In Drive, he reveals the three elements of true motivation:

Autonomy - the desire to direct our own lives
Mastery - the urge to get better and better at something that matters
Purpose- the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves
Along the way, he takes us to companies that are enlisting new approaches to motivation and introduces us to the scientists and entrepreneurs who are pointing a bold way forward.

Drive is bursting with big ideas-- the rare book that will change how you think and transform how you live.

","Not as good as A Whole New Mind
I usually love Daniel Pink's work, but this was tired and repetitive. I find he is insightful and typically puts an original twist on common wisdom. He missed the mark on this one. He used the same formula of his past successes but this one felt like a 50-100 page concept stretched out into a 200 pager to keep publishers happy. I would put the concepts in A Whole New Mind on par with the best works of Malcom Gladwell, Steven Levitt and Nassim Nicholas Taleb. This is recycled, repetitive and doesn't come close to his best.","OK, but could have been a lot better
Daniel Pink makes a reasonable case for a more humane business environment. The keystone of his approach is Autonomy: people need autonomy (the ability to choose what they do, when they do it, how they do it, and who they do it with); and the more they have, the more productive they can be. More importantly, the usual approach of giving bonuses and other rewards for meeting prescribed goals can actually undermine autonomy, and thus productivity, over the long term. Pink cites a number of ingenious experiments that have demonstrated the negative effect of rewards in many situations.

It's not all about autonomy, though. According to Pink, people also need Mastery and Purpose. In other words, they like to get better at doing something that matters. Much of Pink's book is an exploration of ways that people have re-engineered work environments to make those needs easier to meet.

He closes the book with a long chapter on recommendations for change; but as in most books of this type, they are more pep talk than blueprint. Pink describes management in general as being an outmoded technology, but the successes he describes only happened because management gave the new approach their full support.

One aspect of the book I found particularly puzzling. Much of his argument is based on the work of psychologists Edward Deci and Robert Ryan, who propose three basic human needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Mastery is a bit like competence; but what happened to relatedness? It seems to me that could have as big an impact on productivity as anything else.

How Inherited Family Trauma Shapes Who We Are and How to End the Cycle","A groundbreaking approach to transforming traumatic legacies passed down in families over generations, by an acclaimed expert in the field. 

Depression. Anxiety. Chronic Pain. Phobias. Obsessive thoughts. The evidence is compelling: the roots of these difficulties may not reside in our immediate life experiences or in chemical imbalances in our brains - but in the lives of our parents, grandparents, and even great-grandparents. The latest scientific research, now making headlines, supports what many have long intuited: that traumatic experience can be passed down through generations. 

It Didn't Start with You builds on the work of leading experts in post-traumatic stress, including Mount Sinai School of Medicine neuroscientist Rachel Yehuda and psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk, author of The Body Keeps the Score. Even if the person who suffered the original trauma has died or the story has been forgotten or silenced, memory and feelings can live on. These emotional legacies are often hidden, encoded in everything from gene expression to everyday language, and they play a far greater role in our emotional and physical health than has ever before been understood. 

As a pioneer in the field of inherited family trauma, Mark Wolynn has worked with individuals and groups on a therapeutic level for over 20 years. It Didn't Start with You offers a pragmatic and prescriptive guide to his method, the Core Language Approach. Diagnostic self-inventories provide a way to uncover the fears and anxieties conveyed through everyday words, behaviors, and physical symptoms. Techniques for developing a genogram or extended family tree create a map of experiences going back through the generations. And visualization, active imagination, and direct dialogue create pathways to reconnection, integration, and reclaiming life and health. It Didn't Start With You is a transformative approach to resolving longstanding difficulties that, in many cases, traditional therapy, drugs, or other interventions have not had the capacity to touch. ","Mark Wolynn does a masterful job of illuminating the ways in which our ancestors' unresolved suffering, often unknown to us, disables us and binds us painfully to them. He gives us the tools and skills - an approach that combines understanding, imaginative dialogues, and compassionate reconnection - to free and heal ourselves."" (James S. Gordon, MD, author of Unstuck: Your Guide to the Seven-Stage Journey out of Depression)
"" It Didn't Start with You takes us a big step forward, advancing the fields of trauma therapy, mindfulness applications, and human understanding. It is a bold, creative, and compassionate work."" (Sharon Salzberg, author of Lovingkindness and Real Happiness)
""This groundbreaking book offers a compelling understanding of inherited trauma and fresh, powerful tools for relieving its suffering. Mark Wolynn is a wise and trustworthy guide on the journey toward healing."" (Tara Brach, PhD, author of Radical Acceptance and True Refuge)","It Didn't Start With You
I listened to the first 6 chapters of this book and appreciated the author's experience and the experiences of many others that he shared. I found the research about genetics and trauma extremely informative. However, I am a survivor of childhood abuse and suffer from extreme CPTSD ( ptsd that is a result of the caregiver being the perpetrator of the trauma) and I found the author to be lacking in his knowledge of and ability to address my particular experience. In chapter 6 he begins to lead the reader (listener)through an exercise in visualizing the parents as appearing before ones self and noticing the sensations in one's body as they take a step closer. My stomach was clenched in knots and I felt terror and the urge to run as far away as I could get. The author then urges the listener to feel the life force of the parents. I tried to follow along as best I could, denying my urge to turn off the audio. I felt the sensations of electric shocks, sharp and stinging throughout my body. I thought, this is because of the sharp stinging beatings I received constantly from my mother !! The author goes on to give 4 options for the sensations the listener is feeling. He says that if you are feeling closed off or rejecting of your mother the problem is with You and not your mother. He says that one must imagine the mother with all the trauma she must have experienced and realize that she just dis not have the love to give. The examples of trauma that are given are that the mother is too preoccupied with her own traumatic experiences to be able to give the child the love they felt they should have had. I find this author to have a gross misunderstanding and lack of knowledge surrounding child abuse. He seems to have a firm grasp on generational trauma and I understand the premise and intent of his book but these exercises could actually cause more harm than good for those of us who have suffered horrific abuse at the hands of those who were supposed to nurture us."

It is so easy to understand and apply the techniques and it comes with PDF enhancements (just log into your audible account from a desktop, go to your complete library, download and print or use at your will) to assist in you in your progress.","Great book for those dealing with depression!
I highly recommend this book if you struggle with depression. It is very helpful. Note, though, it'll take some work on your part, but it's well worth it.
Having read the Handbook first, and now having listened to this book, I actually recommend the Handbook version first. It forces you to do activities that will help you, whereas this book merely talks about it (in detail). I still liked this book, though, because it reminded me of everything I had done in the Handbook, which is about all I can do while I'm driving, anyhow. (Last I checked, the Handbook is not available in audio.)

The reader of this audio book is excellent. He actually sounds engaged, as though he's Dr. Burns himself, giving you the advice right then and there. Kudos to him. (My only pet peeve about him is he pronounces ""often"" as ""off-ten."" I was glad he didn't also say ""soff-ten,"" ""liss-ten,"" or ""sall-mon."")

IMHO, you can skip the last 2-3 hours of this audio, which deals with antidepressant drugs. It's full of biology and chemistry lessons and lists of side-effects. He also talks ad nauseam about when or why to take drugs for depression. It's ad nauseam because his answer is always the same: therapy alone can work, or therapy plus drugs, but never drugs alone. Unfortunately he felt the need to say that over and over and over again."

On Homecoming and Belonging","We have a strong instinct to belong to small groups defined by clear purpose and understanding - ""tribes"". This tribal connection has been largely lost in modern society, but regaining it may be the key to our psychological survival.

Decades before the American Revolution, Benjamin Franklin lamented that English settlers were constantly fleeing over to the Indians - but Indians almost never did the same. Tribal society has been exerting an almost gravitational pull on Westerners for hundreds of years, and the reason lies deep in our evolutionary past as a communal species. The most recent example of that attraction is combat veterans who come home to find themselves missing the incredibly intimate bonds of platoon life. The loss of closeness that comes at the end of deployment may explain the high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder suffered by military veterans today.

Combining history, psychology, and anthropology, Tribe explores what we can learn from tribal societies about loyalty, belonging, and the eternal human quest for meaning. It explains the irony that - for many veterans as well as civilians - war feels better than peace, adversity can turn out to be a blessing, and disasters are sometimes remembered more fondly than weddings or tropical vacations. Tribe explains why we are stronger when we come together and how that can be achieved even in today's divided world.","Sebastian Junger has turned the multifaceted problem of returning veterans on its head. It's not so much about what's wrong with the veterans, but what's wrong with us. If we made the changes suggested in Tribe, not only our returning veterans, but all of us, would be happier and healthier. Please read this book."" (Karl Marlantes, New York Times best-selling author of Matterhorn and What It Is Like to Go to War)
""There are three excellent reasons to read Sebastian Junger's new book: the clarity of his thought, the elegance of his prose, and the provocativeness of his chosen subject. Within a compact space, the sheer range of his inquiry is astounding."" (S. C. Gwynne, New York Times best-selling author of Rebel Yell and Empire of the Summer Moon)","The most profound book on the subject
I joined the Marine Corps at 17, I invaded Iraq when I was 18 and I fought in Fallujah when I was 19. I then served as the platoon sergeant at the local guard unit while going to college. No book I have ever read about war has ever captured what it all means, not like this one has. This book should be mandatory reading for anyone that serves this country in any capacity."

Secrets to Healing with Herbs, Essential Oils, CBD, and the Most Powerful Natural Medicine in History","Best-selling author Dr. Josh Axe explains how to treat more than 70 diseases, lose weight, and increase vitality with traditional healing practices passed down through the ages.

Long before the first pharmaceutical companies opened their doors in the 1850s, doctors treated people, not symptoms. And although we've become used to popping pills, Americans have finally had it with the dangerous side effects, addiction, and over-prescribing - and they're desperate for an alternative. 

Here's the good news: That alternative has been here all along in the form of ancient treatments used for eons in traditional Chinese, Ayurvedic, and Greek medicine. Ancient Remedies is the first comprehensive layman's guide that will bring together and explain to the masses the very best of these time-tested practices. 

In Ancient Remedies, Dr. Axe explores the foundational concepts of ancient healing - eating right for your type and living in sync with your circadian clock. Listeners will learn how traditional practitioners identified the root cause of each patient's illness, then treated it with medicinal herbs, mushrooms, CBD, essential oils, and restorative mind-body practices. What's more, they'll discover how they can use these ancient treatments themselves to cope with dozens of diseases, from ADHD to diabetes, hypothyroidism, autoimmune disease, and beyond. 

Through engaging language and accessible explanations, Ancient Remedies teaches listeners everything they need to know about getting, and staying, healthy - without toxic, costly synthetic drugs.

Telling the Truth about Perfectionism, Inadequacy, and Power","The quest for perfection is exhausting and unrelenting. We spend too much precious time and energy managing perception and creating carefully edited versions of ourselves to show to the world. As hard as we try, we can't seem to turn off the tapes that fill our heads with messages like, Never good enough! and What will people think? 

Why? What fuels this unattainable need to look like we always have it all together? At first glance, we might think its because we admire perfection, but that's not the case. We are actually the most attracted to people we consider to be authentic and down-to-earth. We love people who are real; we're drawn to those who both embrace their imperfections and radiate self-acceptance. 

There is a constant barrage of social expectations that teach us that being imperfect is synonymous with being inadequate. Everywhere we turn, there are messages that tell us who, what, and how were supposed to be. So, we learn to hide our struggles and protect ourselves from shame, judgment, criticism, and blame by seeking safety in pretending and perfection. 

Based on seven years of ground-breaking research and hundreds of interviews, I Thought It Was Just Me shines a long-overdue light on an important truth: Our imperfections are what connect us to each other and to our humanity. Our vulnerabilities are not weaknesses; they are powerful reminders to keep our hearts and minds open to the reality that we're all in this together. 

As Dr. Brown writes, ""We need our lives back. It's time to reclaim the gifts of imperfection - the courage to be real, the compassion we need to love ourselves and others, and the connection that gives true purpose and meaning to life. These are the gifts that bring love, laughter, gratitude, empathy and joy into our lives.""

","Brené Brown’s ability to explore shame and resilience with humor, vulnerability and honesty is both uplifting and liberating. If we want to change our lives, our relationships or even the world, we must start by understanding and overcoming the shame that keeps us silent. This important and hopeful book offers a bold new perspective on the power of telling our stories."" (Professor Jody Williams, 1997 Nobel Peace Prize Recipient; Campaign Ambassador, International Campaign to Ban Landmines)
""Grounded in exceptional scholarship and filled with inspiring stories, this is one of those rare books that has the potential to turn lives around."" (Harriet Lerner, Ph.D., author of The Dance of Anger)
"" I Thought It Was Just Me can be a doorway to freedom and self-esteem for many, many readers. (Martha Beck, Ph.D., columnist, O, The Oprah Magazine, and author of Finding Your Own North Star)","I have a friend who is always saying he is looking for his last book, meaning something so good and powerful that searching for another perspective is not worth the time. I suggested I have found the last author, but not the last book. Brene Brown is moving, enlightening and so real. I have re-read her books several times. I feel like I was swallowed up as a broken soul and soothed until I could stand on my feet again. I'm not alone, I'm not perfect, I'm just me. I learned that practicing what I believe means loving myself and those around me for who they are, not what they are. Practicing each day means making my life fulfilling and happy. Practicing the art of loving without constraint, without parameters, without any restriction at all is what I want in my life. WOW! Incredible author.

I started with The Gifts of Imperfection. I listened 3 times (in a row no less!) and I have given away 20 copies of the book.

I suggest that if you are looking for your last good book then you have found your last author instead.

Unfortunately this good time will last until you finally realize you're being taken for a ride or until Mr. Time Waster ultimately moves on to a woman he REALLY wants.

This audiobook was designed to show women how men appraise female behavior in order to determine a woman's level of self-respect and therefore her value as a romantic partner.

In this audiobook, you're going to learn:

The most powerful form of male seduction that can KEEP a woman helplessly ""addicted"" to chasing a man.
How to keep a man interested by doing the one thing MOST women are terrified of doing when they find a great guy.
An irritating habit that causes high-quality men to stop pursuing a woman almost INSTANTLY.
How to rebuff undesirable male behavior and get the guy you want to either take you seriously or take a HIKE!
A simple ego-popping phrase that burns into a man's memory, keeps you STUCK on his mind, and makes him DESPERATE to see you again.
How to seduce a man and MELT his heart by overwhelming him with the ONE THING only the RIGHT woman can give him.
And much, much more...
","I AM a High Value Woman
This book is priceless. I chased men for most of my life, clinging to and putting up with any and all behavior from men. I had low self-esteem and never understood my true value as a woman. What an informative, practical book. I am already feeling stronger and hopeful. Thank you so much! God bless.

","sexist, outdated, but lends some truth
Has some helpful information to remind you of, but overall extremely outdated and sexist. Seems to come right out of the 50's. Has some moments of ""girl power"" but not for feminists. It might be offensive if it wasn't so hilarious. Definitely has its moments of truth though and some good reminders to respect yourself, stand up for your worth, and trust your instincts, so I don't necessarily regret listening to it.

Seven Conversations for a Lifetime of Love","Heralded by the New York Times and Time as the couples therapy with the highest rate of success, Emotionally Focused Therapy works because it views the love relationship as an attachment bond.

This idea, once controversial, is now supported by science, and has become widely popular among therapists around the world. In Hold Me Tight, Dr. Sue Johnson presents Emotionally Focused Therapy to the general public for the first time. Johnson teaches that the way to save and enrich a relationship is to reestablish safe emotional connection and preserve the attachment bond. With this in mind, she focuses on key moments in a relationship - from ""Recognizing the Demon Dialogue"" to ""Revisiting a Rocky Moment"" - and uses them as touch points for seven healing conversations.

Through case studies from her practice, illuminating advice, and practical exercises, couples will learn how to nurture their relationships and ensure a lifetime of love.","Interesting. Entertaining. But not always biblical
Interesting entertaining but not always biblical.

A Yogi's Guide to Joy","The practice of what is commonly known as hatha yoga is but one of eight branches of the body of knowledge that is yoga. Yoga is a sophisticated system of self-empowerment that is capable of harnessing and activating inner energies in such a way that your body and mind function at their optimal capacity. It is a means to create inner situations exactly the way you want them, turning you into the architect of your own joy. A yogi lives life in this expansive state, and in this transformative book Sadhguru tells the story of his own awakening from a boy with an unusual affinity for the natural world to a young daredevil who crossed the Indian continent on his motorcycle. He relates the moment of his enlightenment on a mountaintop in southern India, where time stood still and he emerged radically changed.

Teachings and tools for a life of joy

As Sadhguru explains, the term guru means, ""Dispeller of darkness, someone who opens the door for you. As a guru, I have no doctrine to teach, no philosophy to impart, no belief to propagate. And that is because the only solution for all the ills that plague humanity is self-transformation. Self-transformation means that nothing of the old remains. It is a dimensional shift in the way you perceive and experience life."" The wisdom distilled in this accessible, profound, and engaging audiobook offers you time-tested tools that are fresh, alive, and radiantly new. Inner Engineering presents a revolutionary way of thinking about our humanity and the opportunity to achieve nothing less than a life of joy.","This audio book has become a companion and roadmap for me. It's opened up doors to new possibilities and enhanced my capabilities in a way I would not have imagined; offering a way out from the confines of conclusions, a chance to re-look at everything around us to the very air we breathe; showing that the outer workings are no different from the workings within, it is a doorway to incredible adventure and self-discovery that requires nothing from the external.","insightful book.

The Power of Being an Outsider in an Insider World","In the tradition of Susan Cain's Quiet and Scott Stossel's My Age of Anxiety, Atlantic staff writer Olga Khazan reclaims the concept of ""weird"" and turns it into a badge of honor rather than a slur, showing how being different - culturally, socially, physically, or mentally - can actually be a person's greatest strength.

Most of us have at some point in our lives felt like an outsider, sometimes considering ourselves ""too weird"" to fit in. Growing up as a Russian immigrant in West Texas, Olga Khazan always felt there was something different about her. This feeling has permeated her life, and as she embarked on a science writing career, she realized there were psychological connections between this feeling of being an outsider and both her struggles and successes later in life. She decided to reach out to other people who were unique in their environments to see if they had experienced similar feelings of alienation, and if so, to learn how they overcame them. Weird is based on in-person interviews with many of these individuals, such as a woman who is professionally surrounded by men, a liberal in a conservative area, and a Muslim in a predominantly Christian town. In addition, it provides actionable insights based on interviews with dozens of experts and a review of hundreds of scientific studies.

Weird explores why it is that we crave conformity, how that affects people who are different, and what they can do about it. First, the audiobook dives into the history of social norms and why some people hew to them more strictly than others. Next, Khazan explores the causes behind - and the consequences of - social rejection. She then reveals the hidden upsides to being ""weird"", as well as the strategies that people who are different might use in order to achieve success in a society that values normalcy. Finally, the audiobook follows the trajectories of unique individuals who either decided to be among others just like them; to stay weird; or to dwell somewhere in between.

Combining Khazan's own story with those of others and with fascinating takeaways from cutting-edge psychology research, Weird reveals how successful individuals learned to embrace their weirdness, using it to their advantage.","An insightful ode to oddballs.... [Olga Khazan's is] a voice unlike any I can remember encountering on the page. By turns insouciantly candid, calmly authoritative, and poignantly insightful, Khazan's persona has a startling freshness that ultimately wins over the reader.... [She extends] deep empathy and genuine curiosity to her subjects."" (The Washington Post) 

""I feel seen. And I'm confident I'm not the only one who will recognize myself in these pages. Olga Khazan is a witty, engaging writer, and Weird is a compelling journey into the world of 'different' - and a field guide to weaponizing your inner weirdo for the good."" (Maria Konnikova, author of Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes and The Confidence Game) 

""A series of sharp, empathetic portraits.... A winning demonstration of the value of difference."" (Publishers Weekly)","Weird is An Appropriate Title
Could've been much shorter. I think the author took too much time to establish the fact that some people, a good number of people, are weird (I prefer the word ""different""). I would've liked for her to spend much more time on what you do to survive when you are different. what she did provide was excellent. Narrator not appealing."

How to Free Yourself, Change Your Life, and Achieve Real Happiness","The Courage to Be Disliked, already an enormous best seller in Asia with more than 3.5 million copies sold, demonstrates how to unlock the power within yourself to be the person you truly want to be.

Using the theories of Alfred Adler, one of the three giants of 20th-century psychology, The Courage to Be Disliked follows an illuminating conversation between a philosopher and a young man. The philosopher explains to his pupil how each of us is able to determine our own life, free from the shackles of past experiences, doubts, and the expectations of others. It's a way of thinking that is deeply liberating, allowing us to develop the courage to change and to ignore the limitations that we and other people have placed on us. The result is a book that is both highly accessible and profound in its importance. Millions have already read and benefited from its wisdom. This truly life-changing audiobook will help you declutter your mind of harmful thoughts and attitudes, helping you to make a lasting change, achieve real happiness, and find success.","Life Changing
I read a lot and listen to a lot of audiobooks, from classic literature to contemporary biographies, philosophy, psychology and the latest in non-fiction. Seldom do I find a book that surprises me. This one did. Though very familiar with the thoughts of Freud and Jung, I had never heard of their colleague Alfred Adler until I came across this book, interestingly enough through the recommendation of a guy I don’t like. The thoughts of Dr. Adler opened new possibilities and pointed to solutions of problems I have been grappling with for years. His original way of thinking and his method truly can change ones’ life. Even though the questioning young man in the audio version irritated me at times (maybe it was supposed to) the content is so good that I could not turn away. If you are interested in personal growth and how to better navigate the journey of life, allow yourself to get immersed in Adlerian thought through the voice of the philosopher. Chances are, it will change your life as it did mine.

","What an incredible book
Other reviewers aren’t exaggerating when they claim this book can change your life. I have just finished hearing it (the audiobook is a fabulous was to experience the conversation between the curious but frustrated youth and the wise and kind philosopher). I already want to start it again from the beginning and I usually never do that with a book. Buy it. Savour it. And start living it today. This isn’t self-help. This is true human wisdom."

Chasing Dreams, Befriending Pain, and Other Big Ideas","When “Renaissance runner” (New York Times) Alexi Pappas - Olympic athlete, actress, filmmaker, and writer - was four years old, her mother died by suicide, drastically altering the course of Pappas’ life and setting her on a search for female role models. When her father signed his bereaved daughter up for sports teams as a way to keep her busy, female athletes became the first women Pappas looked up to, and her Olympic dream was born. 

At the same time, Pappas had big creative dreams, too: She wanted to make movies, write, and act. Despite setbacks and hardships, Pappas refused to pick just one lane. She put in a tremendous amount of hard work and wouldn’t let anything stand in her way until she achieved all of her dreams, however unrelated they may seem to outsiders. In a single year, 2016, she made her Olympic debut as a distance runner and wrote, directed, and starred in her first feature film. But great highs are often accompanied by deep lows; with joy comes sorrow. 

In Bravey, Pappas fearlessly and honestly shares her battle with post-Olympic depression and describes how she emerged on the other side as a thriving and self-actualized woman. Unflinching, exuberant, and always entertaining, Bravey showcases Pappas’ signature, charming voice as she reflects upon the touchstone moments in her life and the lessons that have powered her career as both an athlete and an artist - foremost among them, how to be brave. Pappas’ experiences reveal how we can all overcome hardship, befriend pain, celebrate victory, relish the loyalty found in teammates, and claim joy. In short: how every one of us can become a bravey.","This is not only an inspiring look inside the mind of a gifted athlete - it’s an arresting debut by a gifted writer. Alexi Pappas reveals how we can find the courage to face our fears, the grit to achieve our goals, and the resilience to bounce forward after failure and heartbreak. I couldn’t put it down.” (Adam Grant, number-one New York Times best-selling author of Originals)

“Bravey heralds the debut of a skilled memoirist. In heartfelt, vibrant prose, Alexi Pappas gives us her captivating life story. A beautiful read that is sure to resonate deeply.” (Ruth Reichl, New York Times best-selling author of Save Me the Plums)

“With Bravey, Alexi Pappas tells a story of persevering through hardship, finding your footing as a leader, and harnessing the unrivaled power of teamwork. Her book, which is candid, funny, and real, offers practical guidance to those looking to forge through obstacles, build their teams, and become leaders in their own lives.” (Abby Wambach, number-one New York Times best-selling author of Wolfpack) ","I now see myself differently
I have struggled with depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts for several years now. This book felt uncomfortable at first when she would talk about her mother’s mental health struggles so candid. As I continued to listen, and heard Alexi’s struggles, I began to feel like I wasn’t alone. I felt uncomfortable at first because I had felt the pain she describes when related to mental health issues, but hearing it can affect successful people normalized it for me. This book may make you cry both sad and good tears, and it is well worth it!!! This book made me see my mental health struggles as only a part of my story rather than something that has to take over my whole life."

A Revolutionary Approach to Success","An innovative, groundbreaking book that will captivate listeners of Malcolm Gladwell, Daniel Pink, The Power of Habit, and Quiet

For generations, we have focused on the individual drivers of success: passion, hard work, talent, and luck. But today, success is increasingly dependent on how we interact with others. It turns out that at work, most people operate as either takers, matchers, or givers. Whereas takers strive to get as much as possible from others and matchers aim to trade evenly, givers are the rare breed of people who contribute to others without expecting anything in return.

Using his own pioneering research as Wharton's youngest tenured professor, Grant shows that these styles have a surprising impact on success. Although some givers get exploited and burn out, the rest achieve extraordinary results across a wide range of industries. Combining cutting-edge evidence with captivating stories, this landmark book shows how one of America's best networkers developed his connections, why the creative genius behind one of the most popular shows in television history toiled for years in anonymity, how a basketball executive responsible for multiple draft busts transformed his franchise into a winner, and how we could have anticipated Enron's demise four years before the company collapsed - without ever looking at a single number.

Praised by best-selling authors such as Dan Pink, Tony Hsieh, Dan Ariely, Susan Cain, Dan Gilbert, Gretchen Rubin, Bob Sutton, David Allen, Robert Cialdini, and Seth Godin - as well as senior leaders from Google, McKinsey, Merck, Estée Lauder, Nike, and NASA - Give and Take highlights what effective networking, collaboration, influence, negotiation, and leadership skills have in common. This landmark book opens up an approach to success that has the power to transform not just individuals and groups, but entire organizations and communities.","Give ‘Til it Helps - Your Company
My first reaction to Andrew M. Grant’s “Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Management” was “You’ve got to be kidding! Are you really telling me that if we hold hands, sing ‘Kumbaya’, and share our shovels in the sandbox, everything will be okay at the office?”
That’s not what Grant was saying - at all – but it took an uncomfortably long time for him to get to that point.

Grant advances the position that those who give generously, both professionally and personally, are more likely to be successful than “takers” (about 15% of people) or “matchers” ( about 70%). It’s a compelling argument, and Grant backs up his position with widely regarded studies and valid statistics. According to Grant, a business organization is well served by finding and developing givers (sharers), whose collaborative work with other givers often returns far more than the work of takers or matchers.

Grant also points out an important fault of givers: Statistically, givers are also more likely to be low achievers or failures, if they become “doormats.” Grant has some valuable tips for doormats to recognize takers, and extract themselves from “no sum” or “negative sum” relationships.

I listened to “Give and Take” on the heels of Sheryl Sandberg’s 2013 “Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead” I wondered until halfway through the book if Grant was even considering women in the workplace. Many of the “giver” techniques he recommends are the very techniques that, when used by women leaders, erode whatever leadership foundation they have.

Grant eventually points out that the communication techniques he is recommending will not work for anyone presenting in a leadership role (at a board meeting, for example), although they will work for a leader as a team member.

Grant has some invaluable tips for how women can effectively negotiate higher salaries and gain respect in an organization, even while they are “givers” (or “sharers”, in my parlance).

This book didn’t have the impact “Lean In” did for me, but it had some invaluable suggestions I will incorporate into my life. I am now much more confident about being a “giver” and recognizing “takers”.

I had an unexpected issue with the narration of this book: Brian Keith Davis, the reader, is so smooth, he reminded me of Casey Kasem, the host of American Top 40. I listened to that radio show every Sunday night as a teenager, eagerly waiting to find out what the new Number 1 song was. Several times, after an especially positive anecdote in “Give and Take”, I expected to hear a current pop song. As I write this review, the Number 1 Billboard song Macklemore and Ryan Lewis’ “Thrift Shop.” That is especially apropos for this book.","recycled material
since I just finished this, my thoughts are very fresh and, I assume, will change over time as I reflect on the material...I have heard so many great things about this book, but it seems that it was essentially a book report around the ""giving"" theme of other, more original work. This reinforced the benefit I gained by reading all of the referenced books, and connected those books around this theme, but provided little new value. However, maybe the genius of the book isn't that Mr Grant has new ideas, but that he wanted to shine a spotlight on other great works and GIVE them more exposure. My guess is that if I was one of the authors of the several books referenced, I'd be flattered and happy to hear my work so highly spoken of.

For decades we've been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. ""F*ck positivity,"" Mark Manson says. ""Let's be honest, shit is f*cked, and we have to live with it."" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn't sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is - a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is his antidote to the coddling, let's-all-feel-good mind-set that has infected modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. 

Manson makes the argument, backed by both academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited - ""not everybody can be extraordinary; there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault"". Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. 

There are only so many things we can give a f*ck about, so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives. ","NGAF - Not as simple as it sounds
Part of me bought this book because I thought it was funny and quirky, part of me bought it because I was sick of giving a f*^k about so many little things that ate up my day, I didn't have any energy for the things that really mattered.

This book isn't about throwing everything to the wind and turning in to a useless blob. It's about giving f^*ks where f^*ks deserve to be given, placing your f^*ks where they're going to do you good instead of drag you down. I highly recommend it, but if you pass on it, I really don't give a f^*k.","EXTREMELY bizarre ending. Spoiler alert
The book starts off great in some banter and stories, the word 'fuck' is thrown around making Mark Manson ultra relatable. The middle is the usual content of self reflection/ self help. -You are part of your problem. It's a refreshing reminder to reevaluate your own thoughts. SPOILER ALERT The last chapter is a confusing near suicide attempt? The book ends with him speaking of how he inched closer and closer the the edge of a cliff and sat on the edge asking himself ""if this is really it, if this is all there is?"" His senses and body take over ultimately grounding him back in reality and leaves him feeling ""alive"" and hopeful. Not my idea of how to end a self help book. I understand the last words are hopeful but the last 10 minutes literally put you on the edge of cliff ""taking microsteps"" inching closer until your legs are dangling over the edge.... rather an inappropriate ending for people that had just invested hours and dollars into self help. I really liked the book up until the last chapter. The last chapter has completely distracted me from the over all message. I dont think I'd recommend although there were several spots I bookmarked and made notes. Wont be buying his other book."

Brave Work. Tough Conversations. Whole Hearts","Number-one New York Times best seller.

Brené Brown has taught us what it means to dare greatly, rise strong, and brave the wilderness. Now, based on new research conducted with leaders, change makers, and culture shifters, she’s showing us how to put those ideas into practice so we can step up and lead. 

Don’t miss the hour-long Netflix special Brené Brown: The Call to Courage!

Named one of the best books of the year by Bloomberg.

Leadership is not about titles, status, and wielding power. A leader is anyone who takes responsibility for recognizing the potential in people and ideas and has the courage to develop that potential.  

When we dare to lead, we don’t pretend to have the right answers; we stay curious and ask the right questions. We don’t see power as finite and hoard it; we know that power becomes infinite when we share it with others. We don’t avoid difficult conversations and situations; we lean into vulnerability when it's necessary to do good work.  

But daring leadership in a culture that’s defined by scarcity, fear, and uncertainty requires skill-building around traits that are deeply and uniquely human. The irony is that we’re choosing not to invest in developing the hearts and minds of leaders at the exact same time as we’re scrambling to figure out what we have to offer that machines and AI can’t do better and faster. What can we do better? Empathy, connection, and courage, to start.  

Brené Brown has spent the past two decades studying the emotions and experiences that give meaning to our lives, and the past seven years working with transformative leaders and teams spanning the globe. She found that leaders in organizations ranging from small entrepreneurial startups and family-owned businesses to nonprofits, civic organizations, and Fortune 50 companies all ask the same question:  

How do you cultivate braver, more daring leaders, and how do you embed the value of courage in your culture? 

In this new audiobook, Brown uses research, stories, and examples to answer these questions in the no-BS style that millions have come to expect and love. Brown writes, “One of the most important findings of my career is that daring leadership is a collection of four skill sets that are 100 percent teachable, observable, and measurable. It’s learning and unlearning that requires brave work, tough conversations, and showing up with your whole heart. Easy? No. Because choosing courage over comfort is not always our default. Worth it? Always. We want to be brave with our lives and our work. It’s why we’re here.”

Whether you’ve read Daring Greatly and Rising Strong or you’re new to Brené Brown’s work, this audiobook is for anyone who wants to step up and into brave leadership.","With Dare to Lead, Brene brings decades of research to bear in a practical and insightful guide to courageous leadership. This book is a road map for anyone who wants to lead mindfully, live bravely, and dare to lead.""","Whether you're leading a movement or a start-up, if you're trying to change an organizational culture or the world, Dare to Lead will challenge everything you think you know about brave leadership and give you honest, straightforward, actionable tools for choosing courage over comfort.""

A Shame-Free Plan for Embracing and Achieving Your Goals","This exclusive Audible edition includes five downloadable prints featuring beautifully designed quotes from the book and access to Rachel's inspirational keynote from the wildly popular Rise Conference.

I believe we can change the world. But first, we’ve got to stop living in fear of being judged for who we are.

Rachel Hollis has seen it too often: women allowing their lives to pass them by. They feel a tugging on their hearts for something more, but they’re afraid of embarrassment, of falling short of perfection, of stepping too far outside the norm. Hollis’s energy and passion are undeniable as she powerfully narrates her own words, encouraging women to live up to their full potential and chase their most audacious dreams.

In Girl, Stop Apologizing, #1 New York Times best-selling author and founder of a multimillion-dollar media company, Rachel Hollis sounds a wake-up call and lets listeners in on her personal roadmap for success. She knows many women have been taught to define themselves through other people—whether as wife, mother, daughter, or employee—instead of learning how to own who they are and what they want. Challenging women everywhere to stop talking themselves out of their dreams, Hollis identifies the excuses to discard, the behaviors to adopt, and the skills to acquire on the path to believing in yourself.
","Author-narrator Rachel Hollis pulls no punches with this manifesto in which she exhorts women to claim the lives that they've always wanted. She sounds direct, confident, and kind. Her warm, down-to-earth style makes this listening experience like having your best friend or a life coach as close as your pocket or earphones. In a friendly tone she lists the main reasons why women don't achieve their dreams or ambitions - such as living their lives in terms of other people - and encourages them to avoid such pitfalls.

The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing","Despite constant efforts to declutter your home, do papers still accumulate like snowdrifts and clothes pile up like a tangled mess of noodles? Japanese cleaning consultant Marie Kondo takes tidying to a whole new level, promising that if you properly simplify and organize your home once, you'll never have to do it again. Most methods advocate a room-by-room or little-by-little approach, which doom you to pick away at your piles of stuff forever. The KonMari Method, with its revolutionary category-by-category system, leads to lasting results. In fact, none of Kondo's clients have lapsed (and she still has a three-month waiting list).With detailed guidance for determining which items in your house ""spark joy"" (and which don't), this international bestseller featuring Tokyo's newest lifestyle phenomenon will help you clear your clutter and enjoy the unique magic of a tidy home-and the calm, motivated mindset it can inspire.

""Narrator Emily Woo Zeller captures the voice of author Marie Kondo so perfectly that it's as if the Japanese de-cluttering guru is speaking in person."" (AudioFile)","I have well over 100 books in my Audible library now, and while I came across several really excellent ones, this was the one that compelled me to write a review for the first time. I would definitely recommend this to a friend and have done so already. It is a fascinating listen. The author approaches such a mundane task as tidying with such passion, creativity and inspiration that I am absolutely amazed. I loved her very last chapter as well, where she points out that if you (the reader) pour as much passion into what you do, the results will surpass all expectations. It felt to me that Marie Kondo uses ""tidying"" as therapy sessions. I have finished her book in two long commutes during this cold and snowy Chicago winter. It was perfect, not too intense and yet so much to think about - my own home, things I possess and why. One other very interesting thing to me was that being a Japanese she describes how things are in Japanese households. I have travelled to Japan many times and I know that Japanese houses are much smaller than those in the US on average. Thus it was very fascinating how the author addressed the need for storing things in a Japanese home."

Reaching the pinnacle of his profession, he became the FBI's lead international kidnapping negotiator.

Never Split the Difference takes you inside the world of high-stakes negotiations and into Voss' head, revealing the skills that helped him and his colleagues succeed where it mattered most: in saving lives. In this practical guide, he shares the nine effective principles - counterintuitive tactics and strategies - you, too, can use to become more persuasive in both your professional and personal lives.

Taking emotional intelligence and intuition to the next level, Never Split the Difference gives you the competitive edge in any discussion.
","NOTHING SHORT OF LIFE-CHANGING
I have never been one to negotiate; I have always been terrified of it whether for my job or in interpersonal situations. This book helped me unearth not only new ways for me to build confidence but also has some incredible negotiation techniques and tips that I had never imagined I would encounter. Worth EVERY penny. I would recommend to you, but I don't want you to know what I now know in case I ever face you. ;) Oh, and outstanding work by the narrator. Kept me engaged the whole time. I couldn't stop listening!","Life Changing
Not many business books have had a profound effect on the way I do business, but this one has changed me and my style of pricing my products and negotiating my services forever. Without making me become heartless, I feel like this book made me think about things differently and that simple paradigm shift has allowed me to make more money right away. I had to negotiate a deal the other day and U did so without anxiety or fear. Unlike so many other business books that waste half the book telling you how great the author is or trying to convince you why you should buy into the concept, this book doesn't waste a minute. I plan to listen more than once because I am sure there are things I can understand more fully after another listen. Strong narration by Michael Kramer. ,Amazing content, and more than the title implies, you will learn how to sell, how to negotiate, and how to walk away and feel good about it, knowing that some people just aren't your customers. I learned that meeting people halfway is poison for my business because it turns out that those are really customers who cannot afford to pay my rates in the first place and then later have no respect for what we do because, of course, they didn't pay full price, so why should they? Since reading/listening to this book less than a month ago, I have gotten full price for deals I would have previously discounted out of fear of losing the deal, and have gotten zero push back from the clients. It was like magic. It just took the guts to try it, which was scary because as a small business owner, it's real money I am playing with. But it worked, and I have changed. This isn't something they teach in business school, but they should. I'm not kidding about it being life changing. My new favorite book of all time for non-fiction. Bravo, Chris Voss."

Wonderfully simple, practical concepts that provide us truly effective methods of expressing and receiving love. Any and all relationships could benefit from the information contained in this book. While it is written from a Christian perspective and focuses almost exclusively on married couples experiencing some level of dysfunction in their marriages, the material can be interpreted in any way that best serves your needs. I myself am not a Christian nor am I married, but this has offered wonderful clarity and help to me and my significant other as we co-create the relationship of our dreams together. Hoping to put these lessons to use to set us up for success so we won't need the damage control down the road!
","Unexpected Brilliance
In one word, amazing! I will make this honest & to the point. As I am Australian we kind of like our info served straight up and no beating around the bush. I get tired of reading reviews that sound over the top of many peoples heads & those that make you wonder if they were paid to write it. Let me tell you this, from start to finish this guy knows his stuff. These Love languages Dr Chapman talks about transcend culture & speech language. They would work for anyone, anywhere in the world that has a desire to seek more from their partnership and is willing to listen. Dont let his funky southern accent put you off, it will actually endear you to him as you grow to admire his insights and find your own penny dropping inside. Everything he said made sense, plain english and would apply to everyone's situation whether married, in a relationship or not. Its real info that can be used to reopen and then keep the channels of communication open between partners. Also info that will make giving & receiving love as well as being lovable so much easier. It doesnt focus so much on the differences between men and women like in the Mars Venus Series of John Gray but more on the WAY we love. It explains why those suggestions you get in magazines dont always work so well. SO refreshing and info that I didnt even know I needed! Our marriage was in a rut & I can honestly say that when trying some suggestions from the book my husband immediately responded. He even wanted to listen to the book with me and we disussed things as we listened. It has brought us so much closer and helped us to connect again while learning more about ourselves and each other. We plan to go further with our ""reading"" as we have a new hobby, listening to books together. I hope Dr Chapman will keep writing! Thanks Dr!

How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead","The number one New York Times best seller. One million copies sold!

From thought leader Dr. Brené Brown, a transformative new vision for the way we lead, love, work, parent, and educate that teaches us the power of vulnerability. 

“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; ...who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.” (Theodore Roosevelt)

Every day we experience the uncertainty, risks, and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable or to dare greatly. Based on 12 years of pioneering research, Dr. Brené Brown dispels the cultural myth that vulnerability is weakness and argues that it is, in truth, our most accurate measure of courage. 

Brown explains how vulnerability is both the core of difficult emotions like fear, grief, and disappointment, and the birthplace of love, belonging, joy, empathy, innovation, and creativity. She writes: “When we shut ourselves off from vulnerability, we distance ourselves from the experiences that bring purpose and meaning to our lives.” 

Daring Greatly is not about winning or losing. It’s about courage. In a world where “never enough” dominates and feeling afraid has become second nature, vulnerability is subversive. Uncomfortable. It’s even a little dangerous at times. And, without question, putting ourselves out there means there’s a far greater risk of getting criticized or feeling hurt. But when we step back and examine our lives, we will find that nothing is as uncomfortable, dangerous, and hurtful as standing on the outside of our lives looking in and wondering what it would be like if we had the courage to step into the arena - whether it’s a new relationship, an important meeting, the creative process, or a difficult family conversation. Daring Greatly is a practice and a powerful new vision for letting ourselves be seen. 

Includes a Bonus PDF with an appendix.","The brilliantly insightful Brené Brown draws upon extensive research and personal experience to explore the paradoxes of courage: we become strong by embracing vulnerability, we dare more greatly when we acknowledge our fear. I can’t stop thinking about this book.","""A wonderful book: urgent, essential and fun to read. I couldn't put it down, and it continues to resonate with me."

Gary explains why that's even more true today, offering his unique perspective on what has changed and what principles remain timeless. He also shares stories from other entrepreneurs who have grown wealthier - and not just financially - than they ever imagined possible by following Crush It principles.

Train Your Mind for Peace and Purpose Every Day","Jay Shetty, social media superstar and host of the number one podcast On Purpose, distills the timeless wisdom he learned as a monk into practical steps anyone can take every day to live a less anxious, more meaningful life.

When you think like a monk, you’ll understand: 

How to overcome negativity
How to stop overthinking 
Why comparison kills love 
How to use your fear 
Why you can’t find happiness by looking for it 
How to learn from everyone you meet 
Why you are not your thoughts 
How to find your purpose 
Why kindness is crucial to success 
And much more
Shetty grew up in a family where you could become one of three things - a doctor, a lawyer, or a failure. His family was convinced he had chosen option three: Instead of attending his college graduation ceremony, he headed to India to become a monk, to meditate every day for four to eight hours, and devote his life to helping others. 

After three years, one of his teachers told him that he would have more impact on the world if he left the monk’s path to share his experience and wisdom with others. Heavily in debt, and with no recognizable skills on his résumé, he moved back home in North London with his parents. Shetty reconnected with old school friends - many working for some of the world’s largest corporations - who were experiencing tremendous stress, pressure, and unhappiness, and they invited Shetty to coach them on well-being, purpose, and mindfulness. 

Since then, Shetty has become one of the world’s most popular influencers. In 2017, he was named in the Forbes magazine 30-under-30 for being a game-changer in the world of media. In 2018, he had the number one video on Facebook with more than 360 million views. His social media following totals more than 38 million, he has produced more than 400 viral videos that have amassed more than eight billion views, and his podcast, On Purpose, is consistently ranked the world’s number one health and wellness podcast.  

In this inspiring, empowering book, Shetty draws on his time as a monk to show us how we can clear the roadblocks to our potential and power. Combining ancient wisdom and his own rich experiences in the ashram, Think Like a Monk reveals how to overcome negative thoughts and habits and access the calm and purpose that lie within all of us. He transforms abstract lessons into advice and exercises we can all apply to reduce stress, improve relationships, and give the gifts we find in ourselves to the world. Shetty proves that everyone can - and should - think like a monk.","Well written book but some home truths must notice
Books is well written and easy to listen. But problem is the ideology author trying to adulate. Author quoting many times and glorifying Manusmriti which is infamous for its misogyny stands and derogatory position of woman and glorifying four varnas – which is the caste system categorizing Hindus and forced to labor based on caste you are born in and practicing untouchability same like racism. Apparently author tried to implement Varna Characteristics as personality test, the underlying principle is the same; Guide (Brahmin – you are top of the hierarchy and just guide Kshtriya and do rituals), Leader (Kshtriya – Born to Lead), Creator (Vaishyas to do Trading) and Maker (Shudras the untouchables - to do all dirty works and server above 3 Castes). Even though author reiterated he’s not endorsing caste system, somehow, he’s glorifying the same which is underlying in the Indian Hindu community!","This book shouldn't be on Audible
I wanted to give this book 4 stars at first. Then I saw multiple videos explaining Jay Shetty using other people's words as his own. Literally quoting a lot of people word for word and put his name beneath it. While he attributes a lot of quotes to the right people in this book a lot of it isn't attributed at all. Sadly one of the things he mentions is that it's better to be an imperfect version of yourself than a perfect version of someone else. During the listen I had moments like ""I heard this before"" and I was correct. It wouldn't even be bad if 90% of the book was cited (correctly) and Shetty hadn't tell a story himself. It still would be valuable. A nice collection of wisdom so to say. However this is not. I think Shetty should feel really bad. I can imagine people feeling at a spiritual low want to listen to this and feeling worse after coming to the conclusion that a book about authenticity (among other things) is itself a fraud. Both audible and the publisher should remove this book and make a statement about it. Note: One of the people exposing Jay Shetty is Nicole Arbour.

If you find yourself struggling, its a good listen, to remind you of how to be you, and how to be good for the world and how to be someone who can take in the good.","Incredible!!!
When I first started listening to this, I almost turned it off because it seemed way too ""new age"" (i.e., spiritual nonsense) for me. I am SO glad I didn't. After the first 2 minutes or so, this book is great. I think this book may have totally changed the way I look at the world. Basically, the author says life is a dream and the way you look at the world will determine if it is a nightmare or an incredible dream. However, rather than using nebulous clich?s like ?just think positive? or ?think big?, he explains how to do it in a much better way than I have ever heard. Some of it you need to take into context, in that, some of what he says might be interpreted as ?I can do no wrong? and ?the rest of the world is messed up but not me?. However, he really says don't beat yourself up over mistakes and just learn from them and move on. Also, he says that people can be way too judgmental (for various reasons which he explains) and you need to be cognizant of this before you accept what they say. Anyway, BUY THIS AUDIOBOOK!!! It is cheap and it could drastically change the way you look at the world. As an added bonus, Peter Coyote, the narrator, is excellent."

Are you tired of feeling f*cked up? If you are, Gary John Bishop has the answer. In this straightforward handbook, he gives you the tools and advice you need to demolish the slag weighing you down and become the truly unf*cked version of yourself. ""Wake up to the miracle you are,"" he directs. ""Here's what you've forgotten: You're a f*cking miracle of being."" It isn't other people that are standing in your way; it isn't even your circumstances that are blocking your ability to thrive. It's yourself and the negative self-talk you keep telling yourself. 

In Unf*ck Yourself, Bishop leads you through a series of seven assertions: 

I am willing 
I am wired to win 
I got this 
I embrace the uncertainty 
I am not my thoughts; I am what I do 
I am relentless 
I expect nothing and accept everything

Was this supposed to motivate me? Help Me? This is the same old crap from a different writer. The author starts off as saying that this book is like no other, No positive thinking will be used since it doesn't work - yet that's exactly what he does during the entire book. Change your thoughts to positive. Catchy title, crappy book. All this stuff is better said in different books. The narrator performance maybe is what made the book worse. I just could not stand the Irish accent on this book. I'm really not sure if it was the reading of the book by the author or the actual content of the book that was worse. I might have enjoyed it a bit more if a different narrator read the book. Paying somebody and extra 100 bucks to read the book might have been better in sales.","If you dream of money, fancy cars and a beautiful supermodel wife...

Growing up in South Carolina with a family that goes back 10 generations, Cameran Eubanks knew from a young age that Southern women are expected to want the white picket fence life. But Cameran has never been your typical Southern belle, and she was always determined to flout expectations. 

She set out to paint the town red, enjoy her single life, focus on her successful real estate career, maybe join the cast of a hugely popular reality show...and then she met her future husband, Jason. After falling in love and getting married, Cameran faced the same dilemma so many women encounter: whether or not to have kids. Ultimately, her own journey to motherhood was anything but simple. 

Now, she takes you deeper into her life - from her first foray into reality TV on The Real World to dating in her 20s to the honest truth about her pregnancy and motherhood - to get to know the person behind the camera. Known as the voice of reason on Southern Charm, she’ll share the same honest advice she gives to her castmates and guide y’all through dating, pregnancy, and motherhood. Charming, hilarious, and a hell of a lot fun, One Day You’ll Thank Me is for anyone who has ever wondered if they should or can.

Features a New Foreword","The 10th-anniversary edition of the game-changing number one New York Times best seller, featuring a new foreword.

For more than a decade, Brené Brown has found a special place in our hearts as a gifted mapmaker and a fellow traveler. She is both a social scientist and a kitchen-table friend whom you can always count on to tell the truth, make you laugh, and, on occasion, cry with you. And what's now become a movement all started with The Gifts of Imperfection, which has sold more than two million copies in 35 different languages across the globe. 

What transforms this book from words to effective daily practices are the 10 guideposts to wholehearted living. The guideposts not only help us understand the practices that will allow us to change our lives and families, they also walk us through the unattainable and sabotaging expectations that get in the way. 

Brené writes, ""This book is an invitation to join a wholehearted revolution. A small, quiet, grassroots movement that starts with each of us saying, 'My story matters because I matter.' Revolution might sound a little dramatic, but in this world, choosing authenticity and worthiness is an absolute act of resistance.""

We are stuck, stymied, frustrated. But it needn't be this way. There is a formula for success that's been followed by the icons of history - from John D. Rockefeller to Amelia Earhart to Ulysses S. Grant to Steve Jobs - a formula that let them turn obstacles into opportunities. Faced with impossible situations, they found the astounding triumphs we all seek.

These men and women were not exceptionally brilliant, lucky, or gifted. Their success came from timeless philosophical principles laid down by a Roman emperor who struggled to articulate a method for excellence in any and all situations.

This book reveals that formula for the first time - and shows us how we can turn our own adversity into advantage.

Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business","This instant classic explores how we can change our lives by changing our habits.

Named one of the best books of the year by The Wall Street Journal and Financial Times

In The Power of Habit, award-winning business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. Distilling vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives that take us from the boardrooms of Procter & Gamble to the sidelines of the NFL to the front lines of the civil rights movement, Duhigg presents a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential. At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, being more productive, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. As Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives. 

“Sharp, provocative, and useful.” (Jim Collins) 

“Few [books] become essential manuals for business and living. The Power of Habit is an exception. Charles Duhigg not only explains how habits are formed but how to kick bad ones and hang on to the good.” (Financial Times)","Few [books] become essential manuals for business and living. The Power of Habit is an exception. Charles Duhigg not only explains how habits are formed but how to kick bad ones and hang on to the good.” (Financial Times)

“Entertaining...enjoyable...fascinating.. a serious look at the science of habit formation and change.” (The New York Times Book Review)

“A flat-out great read.” (David Allen, best-selling author of Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity)","Nice! A guide on how to change
At first I was hesitant to buy this book as I have read several self help books like Today Matters, Awaken the Giant Within, etc. And I just didnt want to buy another one as after a couple of books the information in them starts getting repetitive and the truth is if you actually do what is in one book it will be more than enough. The only problem is that we read a lot and do not persist in doing what we learned form the book...or at least thats the case for me.

But I bough this book anyway as it seemed different and the reviews on it were good. It was worth it.

In the book, the author talks about habits and how to create new ones and stick to them. He doesn't tell you do this and that to be more productive, rather he tells you how to craete habits and then start doing them naturally without effort or thinking...whatever that habit is. He provides scientific evidence that when an act becomes a habit, your brain does less work to do it!

He says for a certain action to become a habit, there are three things:
1. A cue that triggers the action
2. Repetition: You have to repeat the action everytime the cue happens
3. Reward: A reward at the end
And so to change the bad habits that you have, you will not ignore the cue that drove you to that old habit but rather you will act diffrently. In other words, you will satisfy your craving in another way as ignoring it will only solve the problem temporarily and after a while you will go back to your old habits again.
And so you will keep the cue and the reward but change the routine in the middle....but first you need to see what you were really craving. Was it really that chocolate bar you were craving or were you bored at work and wanted a distraction? If it was boredom, then go and socialize instead. Like this you didn't ignore the cue (boredom) or the reward (getting out of boredom) but you simple replaced the bad habit(chocolate) with a good one (socializing).
But he then states that usually people create habits and stick to them until a crisis or pressure comes. At that moment, people usually go back to their old habits mainly because they do not believe in the new system or the new habit. And that adds the fourth element of creating a habit which is belief - belief in the habit and in something bigger - like God. Believing that there is a God or that there is a higher power that will take you through this hard times is essential to keep you going on and not falling back. This will be specially usefull in bad habits like drinking.

He then states that people usually try to change everything at once and thus do that for a little while and then get overwhelmed and return back to all their old habits.
And so to stick to a habit and change your life, you need to select a key stone habit. A key stone habit is a habit that when you change it, all other habits will automatically change. For example, if you write a daily food journal - just writing what you eat, you have not decided to eat less or anything else - just writing what you eat down will eventually make you watch what you eat and change it. Consequently, by just focusing on this one habit you encourged other habits. However, you will not be overwhelmed by a sudden lot of change.

He then talks about grit - which is to keep walking towards your goal for years inspite of challenges and obstacles, and regardless of how long it takes you to achieve it. He says that will power and self discipline are the most important factors for success - not IQ or anything else. That will power is a habit too. That it is a muscle that can be excercised, that when you have will power you start to change how you think. That you have to practice focusing on goals, writing plans and identifying simple cues and obvious rewards. For example, you should write a plan on how one would act in a specific situation. Specifically what you would do when things go wrong or get tough.

He also talks about crisis and how people are more open to change during crisis and that this will be a good opportunity to change social habits.
As for the ingredients for social habits:
1. Protest
2. Peer pressure
3. Must be self prepelling. People have to be participants and not followers
He talks a lot more about social habits but that is just a summary

To sum up he says that to create new habits and to change you have to:
1. Decide to work hard. As it a lot of hard work and will not come easily.
2. Identify cue and reward
3. One has to have self control and be self conscious
That habits are what you choose them to be. That they are the unthinking choices that we make everyday. By making them visible we can change them.

Also, he backs up all this by providing examples and scientific evidence."
