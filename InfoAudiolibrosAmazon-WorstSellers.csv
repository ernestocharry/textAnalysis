A pioneering and timely study of how to navigate life's biggest transitions with meaning, purpose, and skill

Bruce Feiler, author of the New York Times best sellers The Secrets of Happy Families and Council of Dads, has long explored the stories that give our lives meaning. Galvanized by a personal crisis, he spent the last few years crisscrossing the country, collecting hundreds of life stories in all 50 states from Americans who’d been through major life changes - from losing jobs to losing loved ones; from changing careers to changing relationships; from getting sober to getting healthy to simply looking for a fresh start. He then spent a year coding these stories, identifying patterns and takeaways that can help all of us survive and thrive in times of change. ","I was really hoping to learn some life lessons. It was an amazing piece of work as Bruce interviews so many people and learns about their life stories, but there was no real coherent lesson learned here. Other than there are so many directions our lives can go after difficulties and we decide what direction to take.
","Feiler beautifully weaves the themes he finds in thousands of individual life stories to give us a book filled with inspiration and lessons for us all about resilience and the power of change. Transitions may be jolting and difficult, but they can lead to wonderful new beginnings too."

Yet even though children with dyslexia may have trouble reading, they don't have any problems learning; dyslexia has nothing to do with a lack of intellect. ","Yes, hearing Ben tell his story first-hand is great!

The two-time Emmy Award-winning actress has written her first book, a surprisingly raw and triumphant memoir that is outrageous, moving, sweet, tragic, and heartbreakingly honest. Guts is a true triumph - a memoir that manages to be as frank and revealing as Augusten Burroughs, yet as hilarious and witty as David Sedaris.
","I've listened to hundreds of audiobooks and never bothered to review one, but this is one of the best performed audiobooks that I've come across. After listening to this, I would listen to any audiobook performed by Kristen Johnston and her

In The Pattern Seekers, Cambridge University psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen makes a case that autism is as crucial to our creative and cultural history as the mastery of fire. Indeed, Baron-Cohen argues that autistic people have played a key role in human progress for 70,000 years, from the first tools to the digital revolution. 
","Though the book was well-written and had a few interesting things about early man and evolution and inventiveness (or lack of) in our forebearers, the book gives a very simplistic view of autism. There are hundreds of genes and genetic mutations associated with autism, implying all of them could lead to inventiveness is a very simplistic view. Claiming there are easy ways for autistics to be able to work and use these alleged hidden talents is farfetched and the author does not provide specific evidence for what genes would lead to inventiveness.","Ive read several papers of Baron-Cohen’s papers and was excited when this book came out. While autism is not my primary area of focus, a lot of portfolio managers on Wall Street appear to have it, so I wanted to learn more. I was looking for a non-technical book, written by a serious academic which explains the mechanisms behind the condition and this book is perfect. The Pattern Seekers explains the systemization process in a very easy to understand way with interesting little vignettes which makes the book a joy to read. I have already recommended this book to several colleagues and am happy to give this book a glowing review. Paul D. Sonkin - author of Pitch the Perfect Investment"

Psychologist Guy Winch urges us to rethink the way we deal with emotional pain, offering warm, wise, and witty advice for the broken-hearted.

Real heartbreak is unmistakable. We think of nothing else. We feel nothing else. We care about nothing else. Yet while we wouldn’t expect someone to return to daily activities immediately after suffering a broken limb, heartbroken people are expected to function normally in their lives, despite the emotional pain they feel. Now psychologist Guy Winch imagines how different things would be if we paid more attention to this unique emotion—if only we can understand how heartbreak works, we can begin to fix it.","I was really captivated by this book. It not only validated feelings I had about heartbreak, but offered logical and compelling strategies for healing. The concept of disenfranchised grief is well explained by the author. It’s something I never associated as to why short term romantic heartbreaks were just as painful as the loss of a loved one. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for answers or to be healthy after a heartbreak.
","Great content and stories. I hoped there was more information, guides and practical examples on how to fix a broken heart. how wholehearted people deal with heartbreaks etc.

Now, in Between Breaths, Vargas discusses her accounts of growing up with anxiety - which began suddenly at the age of six when her father served in Vietnam - and how she dealt with this anxiety as she came of age, to her eventually turning to alcohol for relief. She tells of how she found herself living in denial, about the extent of her addiction and keeping her dependency a secret for so long. She addresses her time in rehab, her first year of sobriety, and the guilt she felt as a working mother who had never found the right balance.

Honest and hopeful, Between Breaths is an inspiring listen.","I am certain I am not the only one who thought, ""She's telling my story!"" Thank Elizabeth for your courage. A wonderful book that everyone should read so they can become more aware that this disease effects all walks of life. I listened to her audio and loved it.
